        if, else, switch, case, default


                          Undefined Type
- Undefined is a value assigned to any reference if value is not defined.

Syntax:
        var x;
        document.write("x=" + x);        x = undefined

- You can use "undefined" keyword to verify value.

        if(x===undefined)            => returns true if x is undefined, but not good.

        if(x)                        => returns true if x is defined, good code.

        if(x!=undefined)            => returns true if x is defined, not good code.

Ex:
<script>
    var price;
    if(price)
    {
        document.write(`Price=${price}`);
       
    } else {
        document.write("Please provide a value for price");
    }
   
</script>

                            Null
- It is a type defined for reference when value is not provided at runtime.
- You can verify by using "null" keyword.

Syntax:
    var price = prompt("Enter Price");
   
    if(price==null)
    {
    }

                        Non Primitive Data Types

- They are mutable types.
- They don't have fixed range for values.
- Value range varies according to memory available.
- They are stored in memory heap.
- Heap is memory which allows random access.
- JavaScript non-primitive includes
    a) Array
    b) Object
    c) Map
    d) Set (obsolete)

                               Array
- Arrays are used to reduce overhead and complexity.
- Arrays can reduce overhead by storing values in sequential order.
- Arrays can reduce complexity by storing multiple values under the reference of one name.
- Array can handle various types of values in sequential order.
- Array size can change dynamically.

Note: Several computing technologies can't handle different types of memory in
      sequential order and can't change the memory size dynamically. Hence they
      restrict array to similar data type and will not allow to change the size dynamically.
      [C, C++, Java, C#, … ]

- JavaScript array size can change dynamically and can handle various types of values in sequential order.

- Array is a collection arranged in sequential order and allows access in random.


Configuring Array:
- Array declaration comprises of keyword and reference name.
- You can use var, let or const.

Syntax:
        var products;
        let  categories;

- To allocate multiple memory you can initialize or assign memory using 2 techniques

        a) Array meta character "[  ]"
        b) Array Constructor  "Array()"

Syntax:
        var products = [ ];                    => Initializing memory
        var products = new Array();

                (or)
        var products;
        products = [ ];                        => Assigning memory

        var products;
        products = new Array();

- Array meta character "[ ]" is used to allocate static memory, which defined memory for first request and continue the same across any number of requests.

- Array constructor is used to allocate a dynamic memory, which is a discreet memory.
  Memory is newly allocated for every request.

            Static     => Continuous Memory
            Dynamic    => Discreet Memory
