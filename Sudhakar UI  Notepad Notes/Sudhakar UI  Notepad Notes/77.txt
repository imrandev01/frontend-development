Express JS - Express JS is a middleware framework. - Middleware is a software that enables communication in network based application. - Framework is an software architectural pattern. - Software architectural patterns are solutions for enabling and controlling the application 
flow. - They can build the application and control its flow. - There are various software architectural patterns 
        - Black Board System 
        - Microservices 
        - MVC [Model View Controller] 
        - MVP [Model View Presenter] 
        - MVVM [Model View - View Model ] 
        etc. 
 
Setup Express JS: 
 
1. Install express JS 
 
    > npm  install  express --save 
 
2. Configure a server side application using Express 
 
    const express = require("express"); 
 
    let app = express(); 
 
3. App can handle communication between client and server. 
 
    app.get() 
    app.post() 
    app.put() 
    app.delete() 
    etc. 
 
Syntax: 
    app.get('path', function(request, response){ 
 
    }) 
 
4. Start application using listen() 
 
    app.listen(port); 
 
 
Ex: 
index.js 
 
const express = require("express"); 
 
let app = express(); 
 
app.get('/', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send('<h2>Welcome to Express JS</h2>'); 
}); 
 
app.get('/mobiles', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send([{Name:'iPhone 16'}, {Name:'Samsung'}]); 
}); 
 
app.listen(3030); 
console.log(`Server Started http://127.0.0.1:3030`); 
    
 
                                Routing - Routing enables navigation in application. - Routing is a technique used in web application to configure user and SEO friendly URL's. - Routing can be implemented client side and server side. - Server side routes are used to configure request and response. - A route can handle request from client and send a customized response. 
 
Route Flow: 
- A client request is sent to web server. - A Http Handler validates the request and sends to Routing Engine. - Routing Engine verifies the requested path by comparing with the path defined in application 
Route Table. - If requested path is matching then it send a response to client request. - If path mismatch then it sends an error page with HTTP status code. 
 
Configuring Routes: - Every route comprises of a request path and callback function. 
 
Syntax: 
        app.get("path", function() { });   // path:request path  function(){}: callback () 
 - Path comprises of entities and wild cards 
 
    "/"            It executes when user request is not for any specific. 
    "*"            It executes when requested path mismatch. [not found] 
    "/name"        It executes when requested path exactly matches with given name 
    "/colou?r"        It executes when requested path is matching regular expression 
 - The callback function comprises of various objects, the primary are 
        a) request 
        b) response 
 - A request object can request content from client, which includes 
        request.query            => query string 
        request.cookies        => cookies 
        request.body            => form body 
        request.params        => route parameters 
        etc.. 
 - A response object can send customized response to client, which includes 
  file, plain text, html, JSON, XML etc. 
 
        response.json()        => specific JSON response 
        response.send()        => any type of response 
        response.end()        => end the response 
 
Ex: 
index.js 
 
const express = require("express"); 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
let app = express(); 
 
app.get('/', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send('<h2>Welcome to Express JS</h2>'); 
}); 
 
app.get('/mobiles', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send([{Name:'iPhone 16'}, {Name:'Samsung'}]); 
}); 
 
app.get('/c*t', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send('You requested path that uses Regular expression'); 
}); 
 
app.get('/products', (req, res)=>{ 
     mongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017').then(clientObj=>{ 
           var database = clientObj.db("sampledb"); 
           database.collection("products").find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
                res.send(documents); 
                res.end(); 
           }) 
     }) 
}); 
 
app.get('/path',(req, res)=>{ 
      
}) 
 
app.get('*', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send('404 - Requested Path Not Found'); 
}); 
 
app.listen(3030); 
console.log(`Server Started http://127.0.0.1:3030`); 
 
Express JS Framework - Create Server Side App - Routing - Wild Card Routes 
 
 Route Parameters - A route parameter allows to query any content directly from URL. - Parameter is defined in route path. - The values are configured in URL. - You can access route parameters using "request" object. 
 
Syntax: 
       app.get('/path/:param1/:param2', ( req, res ) => { 
 
       }) 
 
      http://server.com/value1/value2 
 
        param1=value1 
        param2=value2 
 
     req.params = { param1:value1, param2:value2} 
 
     req.params.param1;        // value1 
 
Without Route Params: 
 
   http://localhost:3030/products?id=1&name=tv&price=50000 
 
With Route Params: 
 
   http://localhost:3030/products/1/tv/50000 
 
Ex: 
index.js 
 
const express = require("express"); 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
let app = express(); 
 
app.get('/', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send('<h2>Welcome to Express JS</h2>'); 
}); 
 
app.get('/mobiles', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send([{Name:'iPhone 16'}, {Name:'Samsung'}]); 
}); 
 
app.get('/c*t', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send('You requested path that uses Regular expression'); 
}); 
 
app.get('/products', (req, res)=>{ 
     mongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017').then(clientObj=>{ 
           var database = clientObj.db("sampledb"); 
           database.collection("products").find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
                res.send(documents); 
                res.end(); 
           }) 
     }) 
}); 
 
app.get('/products/:id', (req, res)=>{ 
     mongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017').then(clientObj=>{ 
           var database = clientObj.db("sampledb"); 
           database.collection("products").findOne({id:parseInt(req.params.id)}) 
           .then(document=>{ 
               res.send(document); 
               res.end(); 
           }) 
     }) 
}); 
 
app.get('/details/:id/:name/:price',(req, res)=>{ 
     res.send(`Id=${req.params.id}<br>Name=${req.params.name}<br>Price=${req.params.pric
e}`); 
}); 
 
app.get('*', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send('404 - Requested Path Not Found'); 
}); 
 
app.listen(3030); 
console.log(`Server Started http://127.0.0.1:3030`);

What are various types of databases? 
 
Database Models: - Every software application is built with a set of modules.  - Each module have different roles and responsibilities.  - Every module doesn't require data to maintain. - Developer have to identify the modules that require data and design database models 
  
 a) Conceptual Model 
 b) Physical Model 
 c) Logical Model 
 d) Entity Model 
 
Conceptual Model - It comprises of a list of modules that require data. 
- It is a database model for initializing the data requirements.  
Syntax: 
                         admin 
  user 
  product 
 
Physical Model - It comprises of information or data related to each module. - It is a database model that contains information about the fields and their data type. 
Syntax: 
  tbladmin 
   admin_id [number] 
   admin_name[string] 
   password [string] 
 
   tblproduct 
   product_id [number] 
   name [ string ] 
   price [ number ] 
   rating [number] 
 
Logical Model - It contains information about relationship between modules. - It is a database model to configure relationship using Primary & Foreign Key. 
  tblProduct 
   product_id [PK] 
   name  
   CategoryId [FK] 
 
tblCategory  
category_id [PK] 
name 
Entity Model - It is the complete business model. - Entity refers to business requirements. - It is a database model that comprises of details like table, field, data type, relationship etc. - It is a blue print for designing database.  - The final model is known as "Entity Relationship Diagram". 
Syntax: 
tblcategory 
category_id : number [PK] 
name : string 
tblproduct 
product_id : number [PK] 
name : string 
category_id: number [FK - reference tblCategory] 
Note: Make sure that your MySQL server is running in background. - Open "services.msc"  on your PC - Right click on "MySQL" and select start. 
MySQL Environment: - Every database system comprises of 2 environments 
1. Server 
2. Client 
- Server is the location where your data is kept. - Client is the location from where you interact with the data. - The client tool is "MySQL Workbench". 
Database Objects: 
 
1. Database   : It is store used to maintain data required for application. 
2. Table    : It is schema for database used to store data for various  
                     modules in application.  
3. View    : It is a virtual data set that comprises of data filtered, sorted 
         or grouped from various tables or from specific table.  
4. Stored Procedure                : It is used to refactor the statements. 
         Refactor is the process of encapsulating a set of statements. 
                     So that you can reuse across various locations. 
                     A procedure can return or can be void. 
 
5. Function    : It is used to evaluate a value with any expression.  
                                             You can build expressions using function. 
6. Trigger   : It is used to execute a set of procedures or functions  
       in a sequential order.  
7. Form  : It provides an UI for database, so that developer can 
       easily interact with database & its objects. [CRUD] 
 
8. Report                  : It a process of generating a document that exports your 
           data into various formats like "pdf, xlsx, csv" etc. 
            Report is a document that shows your data and allows to 
             export & print. 
 
9. Macros   : It is used to design batch operations. 
      Batch operations are a set of sequential operations you  
      want to execute repeatedly. 
 
SQL Language: - Structured Query Language. - It is a language used by developer to communicate with database objects. - It uses various operators and functions to handle communication.  - Based of type of operations the language is classified into 3 types 
  a) DDL 
  b) DML 
  c) DCL - Data Definition Language used to configure and create the data objects. - Data Manipulation Language used to filter, sort, group and manage data. - Data Control Language allows to handle security like authorization, authentication. 
1. Creating a new Database 
  
    create  : It is used to create various database objects like 
     database, 
    view,  
    stored procedure  
    trigger etc. 
Syntax: 
 create  database  databaseName; 
 create  schema    databaseName; 
Ex: 
 create database  shopping; 
2. Select database to start using it 
Syntax: 
  use  databaseName; 
  use  shopping; 
 
   MySQL Tables - Table provides a schema to store data in rows and columns. - You can use "create" command for creating a new table. 
 
Syntax: 
  create  table  table_name 
  ( 
 
  ) 
 - Table comprises of fields with following details 
 
  a) field name 
  b) data type 
  c) constraint  
 
Syntax: 
    create  table  table_name 
    ( 
        field_name  data_type   constraint, 
    ) - MySQL data type determines the type of value you can store in a field. Some of the 
popular MySQL types are  
   Number Types: 
   INT    Signed & Unsinged 
   Decimal()   Float, double, decimal  
   Float   Float 
   Double   Double  
 
  String Type: 
   VARCHAR 
   LONGTEXT 
   MEDIUMTEXT 
   CHAR 
    
  Date & Time Type: 
 
   DATE 
   TIME 
   DATETIME 
   YEAR 
 
  Boolean Type: [There is no specific Boolean type in MySQL] 
 
   TINYINT   0 = false, 1 = true 
Syntax: 
  
  create  table  tblproducts 
  ( 
      ProductId  INT, 
      Name  VARCHAR(30), 
      Price    Decimal(6), 
      Stock   TINYINT, 
      Mfd      DATE 
  ) 
 
MySQL Constraints: - Constraint controls the behavior of field and its value. 
- MySQL table field can use various types of constraints. 
1. Primary Key 
2. Unique Key 
3. Foreign Key 
4. Check 
5. Not Null 
6. Default  
Primary Key Constraint: - Every record in database table requires a unique identification. - It is used for querying and manipulating specific record.  - Every table can have only one primary field. 
Unique Key Constraint: - A database table requires few fields with unique values. - The value given for one record can't be used for another record.  - You can't have multiple primary keys in a table. - Hence a unique key constraint can be used for field. - Table can have multiple unique key fields. 
Check Constraint: - It is used to check the input value by matching with any expression. - It allows to store value into field only when it is matching the given expression.  - It uses a validator to validate the input value. - It ensures that contradictory and unauthorized data is not get stored into database. 
Default Constraint: - It is used to configure a default value for field. - If a value is not provides for field in database table, then it is set to null. - You can avoid null and use a default value to store by using default constraint.  
 
Not Null Constraint: - It ensures that the field is not empty. - It will not allow null.  - It is used for required fields.  - If a default value or explicit value is not defined then it will not allow to save data. 
 
Foreign Key Constraint: - It configures the relation ship between fields from multiple tables. - It is a primary of a table used as a reference in another table. - You can have multiple foreign keys to configure various relation ships like 
 a) One-to-One 
 b) One-to-Many 
 c) Many-to-Many 
 
Syntax: 
 create table  tblProducts 
 ( 
   ProductId   INT  Primary Key, 
   Name varchar(30), 
   Price decimal(6,2), 
   Mfd  Date 
 ) 
 
Creating a table with various constraints: 
1. Primary Key :  It uses  "PRIMARY KEY"   
                            :  It sets   UNIQUE  & NOT NULL. 
Syntax: 
 create table  tblcategories  
 ( 
    CategoryId  INT   PRIMARY KEY, 
    CategoryName  varchar(20) 
 ) 
 
2. Not Null : It uses  "NOT NULL"  
Syntax: 
 create table tblcategories 
 ( 
   CategoryId  INT  PRIMARY KEY, 
   CategoryName  varchar(20)  NOT NULL 
 ) 
 
 
3.  Unique : It uses  "UNIQUE"  
 
Syntax: 
 create table tblcategories 
 ( 
   CategoryId  INT  PRIMARY KEY, 
   CategoryName  varchar(20) NOT NULL   UNIQUE  
 ) 
 
     Unique verifies only the value and ignores the capitalization.  
      
4. Default : It uses "DEFAULT" 
      It takes are default value. 
      Value type must match the field type. 
 
Syntax: 
 create  table tblproducts 
 ( 
    ProductId  INT  PRIMARY KEY, 
    Name varchar(40) NOT NULL, 
    Qty INT  DEFAULT 1 
 ) 
 
5. Check: It uses "CHECK" with any condition. 
    Condition requires decision making operators. 
 
Syntax: 
 create table tblProducts 
 ( 
    ProductId  INT  PRIMARY KEY, 
    Name varchar(40) NOT NULL, 
    Qty INT  DEFAULT 1 CHECK(Qty<5) 
 ) 
  Comparison Operators 
  >   greater than 
  >= greater than or equal 
  <  less than 
  <=  less than or equal 
   !=  Not equal 
  =  Equal  
  Logical Operators 
  AND   
  OR 
  NOT 
 
6. Auto Increment: It allows to increment the value of a field by 1 and add  
       to preceding field. 
       It uses "AUTO_INCREMENT" 
       The default value starts with 1. 
       The preceding value depends on the previous value. 
 
Syntax: 
create table tblproducts 
( 
  ProductId INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, 
  Name varchar(30) NOT NULL, 
  Qty INT DEFAULT 1 CHECK(Qty<5) 
) 
 
Note: Auto_Increment can be defined only for fields that handle numeric type data. 
 
 
7. Foreign Key : It uses "FOREGIN KEY" with "REFERENCE"  
    Reference is from a table that have relationship with  
  current table. The foreign key constraint changes according to type of  
relation ship. 
  a) One-to-One 
  b) One-to-Many 
  c) Many-to-Many 
 
Business Model of i-shop Application:  
1. Conceptual Model of i-shop 
  - Customers 
- Admin - Vendors - Shopping Cart - Products - Shipping & Billing - Categories 
Foreign Key Constraint: - It is used to configure relationship between fields in tables.  - You can configure any relationship like 
a) One-to-One 
b) One-to-Many 
c) Many-to-Many - Foreign key field must be defined in the table where you want to configure relationship. - The field name and data type must match with the reference table field. - The foreign key constraint is created to configure relationship between table. 
Syntax: 
Constraint  constraint_name 
FOREIGN KEY  (foreign_key_fieldName) 
REFERENCES  reference_table_name(reference_field_name) 
ON UPDATE  reference_type 
ON DELETE  reference_type - A constraint name is required to modify or delete constraints.  - Foreign key field name is the field in current table that you want as foreign key. - Reference table name is the table that contains fields that you want to connect with the 
foreign key. - Reference types are configured to setup relationship between tables so that they can 
control the data from parent.  - There are 3 reference types 
a) RESTRICT 
b) CASCADE 
c) SET NULL - The reference types define the actions to perform when the parent field is modified or 
deleted.  - The default reference type is "RESTRICT". 
RESTRICT: - It configures the relation between parent and child tables. - Restrict indicates that the parent field can't be modified or deleted if it comprises of 
relative fields in child.  
Syntax: 
1. Create Parent table 
create table tblcategories 
( 
) 
CategoryId INT PRIMARY KEY,  
CategoryName varchar(30) 
2. Create a table with Foreign Key relation 
create table tblproducts 
( 
ProductId INT PRIMARY KEY, 
Name varchar(30), 
CategoryId INT,  
CONSTRAINT fk_categories FOREIGN KEY (CategoryId)  
REFERENCES tblcategories(CategoryId)  
ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE RESTRICT 
) 
CASCADE: - It is a relationship type configured for foreign key. - Cascade indicates that if foreign key field from parent table is deleted or modified then it 
removes all relative records from all tables that have relation with the field. 
Syntax: 
create table tblproducts 
( 
) 
ProductId INT PRIMARY KEY, 
Name varchar(30), 
CategoryId INT,  
constraint fk_categories FOREIGN KEY (CategoryId)  
REFERENCES tblcategories(CategoryId)  
ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE 
SET NULL - It is a relationship type configured for foreign key. - It is used to SET null as value into the data of table that have relationship with parent. - If field is changed or deleted the relative data is set to Null. 
Syntax: 
create table tblproducts 
( 
ProductId INT PRIMARY KEY, 
Name varchar(30), 
CategoryId INT,  
constraint fk_categories FOREIGN KEY (CategoryId)  
REFERENCES tblcategories(CategoryId)  
ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE SET NULL 
) 
FAQ's: 
1. Can we define multiple foreign key fields? 
A. Yes. You can define from or multiple tables. 
Syntax: 
constraint  fk_name   Foreign Key (Field1, Field2, ..) 
References  tblName(field1, field2,...) 
2. Can we configure multiple constrains? 
A. Yes. If fields are from various tables then you can have a constraint for every table.

Foreign Key Constraints  
Inserting Data into Tables - SQL "INSERT" command is used to insert data into a database table. - It uses table name, field name and values to insert into table. 
Syntax: 
INSERT  INTO  table_name (field1, field2, ..)  VALUES (value1, value2); - You have to follow all constraint rules defined to design data table while inserting data. 
- You have to define exactly the same data type for value as defined in structure.  - Numeric types are defined with number as value. - String types are defined with single quote 'value'. - Dates are defined with single quote in 'YY-MM-DD' format. 
 
Ex: 
 INSERT  INTO  tblcategories  (CategoryId, CategoryName)  VALUES 
        (1, 'Electronics'); 
 - You can insert multiple records into table using a "," delimiter.  
 
Ex:  INSERT INTO tblcategories (CategoryId, CategoryName) VALUES 
       (2, 'Fashion'), 
       (3, 'Footwear'), 
       (4, 'Accessories'); 
 
 Query Data from Tables: - Query allows you to read and return the data from a database table. - SQL provides a "SELECT" command for querying. - SELECT refers to field names and uses various operators to fetch data from table. - Different operators allow to filter and sort the data. 
 
Syntax: 
      SELECT  field_Name  FROM tableName; 
 - You can use "*" meta character to search for all fields from table. 
 
Syntax: 
 SELECT  *  FROM table_Name; 
Note: Avoid using meta character in query to improve the query performance. 
Ex: 
SELECT  CategoryId, CategoryName  FROM tblcategories; 
SELECT   * FROM tblcategories; - SELECT allows to alias the field name while querying. It is good to display field name in user 
friendly format.  - It requires "AS" operator for aliasing the field names. 
Syntax: 
SELECT  field_name  AS  alias_name  FROM  table_name; 
Ex: 
SELECT CategoryName AS  'Product Category'  FROM  tblcategories; - You can set alias for multiple fields. 
Ex: 
SELECT   CategoryId  AS  'Category ID',  CategoryName AS  'Product Category' 
FROM  tblcategories. - SELECT allows to embed any expression, evaluate the expression and store the result in an 
alias field. - Expression can be any arithematic or by using any built-in functions. 
Syntax: 
  SELECT  field_name  (expression) AS  alias_name  FROM table_Name; 
 
Ex: 
  SELECT   Name, Price, Qty, (Qty * Price) AS  Total FROM tblproducts; 
 
  SELECT   FirstName, LastName, (concat('FirstName', 'LastName')) AS 'Full Name'  
  FROM tblEmployees;

 Updating Table Data - SQL provides "UPDATE" command to modify table data. - To update any value you have to find the value using "WHERE" command. - You can use all comparison and logical operators to find the data. - Updating new data into existing field is done by "SET" command. 
 
            UPDATE        =  ACTION 
            WHERE        =  QUERY to FIND 
            SET            =  ASSIGN NEW VALUE 
 - MySQL "Safe Mode" is default set to ON. - It is a secured mode that allows to update the data only by using "PRIMARY KEY" field. 
 
Syntax: 
   UPDATE  tableName  SET  field_name=newValue WHERE  primary_key_field=value; 
 - You can update multiple fields using "," delimiter. 
 
Ex: 
Update tblproducts SET Name='Samsung TV', Qty=3 WHERE ProductId=1; 
 - You can set safe update data mode to false in order enable update without a Key field. 
 
Syntax:     
        SET   SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0 
 
        1 = true,  0 = false 
 
Ex: 
update tblproducts set Qty=3 where Category='Electronics';    // valid only when safe 
                                                       mode is off. 
 
Query: Update rating to 4 for electronic products whose price is above 40000? 
A:  Update tblproducts SET Rating=4 WHERE (Category='Electronics' AND Price>40000) 
 
 
  Updating Table Structure - SQL provides "ALTER" command to modify and update structure of table and fields. - Table structure includes adding fields, changing field name, removing field, changing data   
type of field etc. - It also includes adding and removing constraints. 
 
1. Adding a new Field to table. - ALTER requires "ADD" command to add a new field. - You have to use helpers commands that specify where to add the field. - You can add "AFTER" specific field or as "FIRST" field. - Alter command can alter a table, view, constraint or any database object. - To modify the a table it require "TABLE" command. 
 
Syntax: 
   ALTER  TABLE table_name 
    ADD  field_name data_type  constraints 
   AFTER | FIRST  field_name; 
 - If you don't define the helper command then it adds new field as last field. 
 
Ex: 
alter table tblvendors 
ADD VendorRating INT AFTER VendorName; 
 
Note: You can view the table structure by using the "DESCRIBE" command. 
 
Syntax: 
        DESCRIBE   table_name; 
 
2. Modifying the field structure. - You can modify existing field structure. - It requires ALTER to use "MODIFY" command. - You can modify the data type or constraints. - You can't directly modify the foreign key constraints. - You have to define the data type of field every time while modifying the structure. 
 
Syntax: 
     ALTER  TABLE  table_name 
 
            MODIFY   field_name  data_type  constraint; 
 
Ex: 
Alter table tblproducts 
  MODIFY Qty int NOT NULL 
 - You can add or modify multiple fields with different constraints. 
 
Ex: 
ALTER TABLE tblproducts 
 
  MODIFY Qty int NOT NULL DEFAULT 1, 
  MODIFY Rating int NOT NULL 
 
3. Modify the Field Name - Alter command provides "CHANGE" helper that allows to change the filed name. - You have to define the data type for field while changing the name. 
   [It is not mandatory in latest versions] - You can set the position of field while defining new name "FIRST | AFTER". 
 
Syntax: 
 
 ALTER TABLE  table_name CHANGE COLUMN 
  old_field_name  new_name  FIRST | AFTER field_name;   // valid with beta versions 
 
Syntax: 
  ALTER TABLE  table_name CHANGE COLUMN 
    old_field_name   new_name data_type  FIRST|AFTER  field_name; 
 
Ex: 
alter table tblproducts change column  Qty  Quantity int after Price 
 
4. Remove field from table - ALTER provides  "DROP" command to remove the field from table. - It completely depends on Cascade and Restrict references defined while 
  creating table. - Usually cascade and restrict are defined while configuring foreign key relation between 
tables. - DROP COLUMN is used to remove any specific column from table. 
 
Syntax: 
    ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN  field_name; 
 - You can drop multiple columns 
 
Syntax: 
    ALTER TABLE table_name 
        DROP COLUMN  field_name, 
        DROP COLUMN  field_name 
 - You can't drop a column if it is defined with "restrict" reference. 
Managing Primary Keys: - Table can have only one primary key field. - You can remove a primary and set another field a primary key. 
 
Syntax: 
    alter table tblvendors  Drop Primary Key; 
 
    alter table tblvendors Add primary key (VendorName); 
 - If you want multiple unique key fields then add UNIQUE constraint. 
 
Managing Foreign Key: - Table can have multiple foreign keys. - You can add a new foreign key field 
 
Syntax: 
    alter table tableName  Add  constraint  constraint_name 
        FOREIGN KEY (fieldName) 
        REFERENCES referenceTableName(fieldName) 
        ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE 
 - You can remove foreign key by using drop command and constraint name. 
 
Syntax: 
    alter table tableName  DROP constraintName; 
 
    alter table  tblproducts  DROP  fk_categories; 
 
 
                         DELETE Command - SQL DELETE command allows to delete table data. - You can delete using various condition with "WHERE". - You can also limit deleting number of records using "LIMIT". 
 
Syntax: 
    DELETE  FROM  tableName  Where  condition  LIMIT count; 
    DELETE  FROM  tableName  Where  condition; 
 
Ex: 
    Delete  from  tblproducts where  ProductId=4; 
    Delete  from tblproducts where Category='Electronics' LIMIT 3; 
 
Query: How to delete the top 3 rating products from table? 
 
Ans:         Delete from tblproducts order by Rating desc limit 3 
 
                           Stored Procedures(function) - Computer programming provides "Refactor" mechanism. - Refactor allows to extract a set of statements and enclose as a single unit. So that you can 
reuse the statements without rewriting. - Programming languages allow refactor by using 
    a) Function 
    b) Method 
    c) Procedure - A function is intended to return a value. It can't be void. - A method is always void it is not intended to return value. - A procedure can return value or can be void type. It can change according the situation 
and state. - SQL allows to create procedures, so that they can return the value or can be void. 
 
Creating a Stored Procedure: - A procedure may contain multiple set of statements. - Various statements in a procedure need to be separated. - Hence every procedure requires a delimiter. [Separator] - The "DELIMITER" keyword is used to configure a separator for stored procedure. - DELIMETER is mandatory for stored procedures in MySQL. - The default delimiter is "$$". You can customize the delimiter. 
 
Syntax: 
    DELIMITER  $$ 
 
        // your procedure 
 
    DELIMITER; 
 - Procedure is created by using "CREATE PROCEDURE" command. 
 
Syntax: 
      Create Procedure  procedureName() 
      - Statements in procedure are defined using "BEGIN" & "END" block. 
 
Syntax: 
      create procedure  procedureName() 
      Begin 
        statements; 
      End $$ 
 
Syntax: 
    DELIMITER $$ 
    
       Create Procedure  procedure_name () 
       Begin 
          statements; 
       End$$ 
    
    DELIMITER; 
 - You can execute the statements by calling stored procedure. 
 
Syntax: 
      call  procedure_name(); 
 
Ex: 
DELIMITER $$ 
   create procedure GetFootwear() 
   Begin 
      Select * from tblproducts where Category='Footwear'; 
   End$$ 
DELIMITER ; 
 
Ex: 
    call GetFootwear();   // call procedure 
 
Note: Stored procedures are required to reduce Injection Attacks. 
 
Syntax: 
    DELIMITER $$ 
 
        CREATE  PROCEDURE   sp_name() 
        BEGIN 
            // statements; 
        END$$ 
 
    DELIMITER; 
 
                            Parameters - A procedure can be parameter less or parameterized.   - If procedure is parameter less, then it performs the same functionality every time. - Parameters allow to modify the procedure. - A procedure can handle different functionalities using parameters. - It can change according to state and situation. 
 
Syntax: 
      Create Procedure  sp_Name(params) 
       Begin 
 
       End 
 
       call  sp_Name(value); 
 - Every procedure comprises 
    a) Declaration 
    b) Definition 
    c) Signature 
 
    CREATE PROCEDURE  spName(params)   => Declaration 
 
    BEGIN  ...statements... END                 => Definition 
 
    spName(value)                         => Signature 
 
- Declaration defines the name and its configuration. - Definition defines the functionality. - Signature is used to access the procedure or call the procedure. - The parameters defined while declaring a procedure are known as "Formal Parameters". - The parameters defined while calling procedure are known as "Actual Parameters". 
 
Syntax: 
        Create  Procedure sp_Name(formalParameter) 
        Begin 
        
        End; 
 
        sp_Name(actualParameter); 
 
        formalParameter = actualParameter 
 - Parameters that are configured in procedure are classified into 3 types 
    
    a) IN 
    b) OUT 
    c) INOUT 
 - "IN" parameter takes a value and uses the same value across all statements that are 
executed by a procedure. - "OUT" parameter can change its value according to the statements. It is not constant across 
multiple statements in procedure. - "INOUT" can switch between IN & OUT according to situation. - Every parameter requires 
    a) Parameter Name 
    b) Data Type 
 
Syntax: 
    Create Procedure  sp_Name(IN | OUT  paramName  datatype) 
    Begin 
 
    End 
 - Every parameter is a required parameter. It is mandatory to define a value for parameter. - The compiling system identifies the parameters as arguments. - The number of arguments defined in declaration, the same number of parameters are 
required. 
 
IN Parameter: - It takes a value and uses as constant across various statements in procedure. - The value defined can't be assigned with a new value inside the procedure. 
 
Ex: 
DELIMITER $$ 
   create procedure GetByCategory(IN categoryName varchar(20)) 
   Begin 
      Select * from tblproducts where Category=categoryName; 
   End$$ 
DELIMITER ; 
 
call  GetByCategory('Electronics'); 
call  GetByCategory('Fashion'); 
 - IN parameter allows to input value. - You can configure multiple IN parameters for a procedure. 
 
Syntax: 
    Create Procedure sp_Name(IN param1 datatype, IN param2 datatype) 
    Begin 
 
    End 
 
Ex: 
DELIMITER $$ 
   create procedure GetCategoryRating(IN categoryName varchar(20), IN rating int) 
   Begin 
 
      Select * from tblproducts where (tblproducts.Category=categoryName) AND 
(tblproducts.Rating> rating); 
 
   End$$ 
DELIMITER ;

    Begin 
        ....statement.. expression_result  INTO paramName; 
    End 
 - Out parameters are configured in procedure call by using "@paramName". - You can access the out parameter and render its value by using "SELECT" command. 
 
    sp_Name(@paramName); 
    select @paramName; 
 
Ex: 
DELIMITER $$ 
   create procedure GetAvgPrice(out avgPrice int) 
   Begin 
      Select avg(Price) into avgPrice from tblproducts; 
   End$$ 
DELIMITER ; 
 
call GetAvgPrice(@avgPrice); 
select @avgPrice; Stored Procedure 
Parameters 
 
                             Variables - Variables are storage locations in memory where you can store a value and use as a part of 
any expression. - Variables are declared by using "DECLARE" keyword. - Variable requires a name and data type to define. 
 
Syntax: 
        DECLARE   variableName  datatype; 
    
Ex: 
        declare  productName  varchar(30); 
        declare  price decimal(8,2); 
        - Variable configuration comprises of 3 phases 
        a) Declaring 
        b) Assignment 
        c) Initialization - Declaring is the process of configuring variable name and data type. 
 
        Declare  price  decimal(8,2); 
 - You can assign value into variable after declaring, by using "SET" keyword. 
 
        SET  price = 4500.44; 
 - Initialization is the process of defining a value into variable while declaring variable. - You can initialize value by using "DEFAULT" keyword. 
 
        Declare price  decimal(8,2)  default  0.00; 
 - Variable scope restricts the accessibility of variable. - If any variable is declared outside procedure then it is global. - If variable is declared inside procedure then it is block scope. - The default query window where you run queries will not allow to define a global variable. - All variables must be in the scope of Begin & End. - You can't access variable outside the procedure, hence you need an out parameter to store 
the result. 
 
Ex: 
 
DELIMITER $$ 
 
  create procedure spGetRating(out result int)   
  Begin 
     declare rate int default 0; 
  
     select avg(Rating) into rate from tblproducts; 
      
     set result = rate; 
      
  End$$ 
 
DELIMITER ; 
 - Run the procedure 
 
call spGetRating(@result); 
select @result; 
 - You can use statements like "IF" & "CASE" to handle decision making in a stored procedure. 
 
Syntax: 
        if   condition  then 
            statements; 
            elseif condition  then 
            statements; 
        else 
            statements; 
        end if; 
 - IF statements checks all conditions until satisfied. It is slow when there are many 
  conditions to verify. - Case statements executes exactly the block that matches given condition. It is faster in 
execution when there are many conditions. 
 
Ex: 
 
DELIMITER $$ 
  
  create procedure spGetReview(in id int, out review varchar(40)) 
  Begin 
      
     declare rate int default 0; 
     declare msg varchar(40); 
 
     select Rating into rate from tblproducts where ProductId=id; 
      
     if rate > 4 then 
                set msg = 'Very Good  - Product have good quality'; 
         elseif rate >= 3 AND rate <= 4 then 
        set msg = 'Average - Product have avg quality '; 
     else 
                set msg = 'Poor - Product have poor quality'; 
     end if; 
      
     set review = msg; 
      
  End$$ 
 
DELIMITER ; 
 - Call procedure 
 
call spGetReview(1, @review); 
select @review 
 
Task-1: Create similar procedure to display product name and its review. 
Task-2: Select Product Name, Vendor Name from tblproducts

            ------------------------------------------------------- 
            1     TV          Bajaj                 Hyd 
            2     TV          Bajaj                Delhi 
            3    TV         Reliance           Chennai 
 
          Create a  variable that contains your City 
            declare  yourCity  varchar(20)  default  'Delhi' 
          Get the vendor city and compare with your city 
            
            if yourCity==vendorCity 
                msg = "Same Day Delivery" 
            else 
                msg  = "Next day delivery" 
 
       call  spDelivery(1, 'Delhi', @msg) 
 - SQL Joins & View 
SQL Joins - Join allows to compare data in multiple tables. - You can query and Join data from multiple tables so that you can view difference between 
data in tables. - Join are categories into following types 
 
    a) Inner Join 
    b) Cross Join 
    c) Left Join 
    d) Right Join 
 - Join comprises of left and right tables with fields from both tables queried  using a 
condition. 
- Condition is defined by using "ON" keyword. 
 
Syntax: 
    Select  fields_from_both_tables  FROM table_left  JOIN table_right  ON Condition; 
 - You can use "AS" for aliasing the fields while querying data from different tables. 
 
Ex: 
1. Create tables 
            allvendors 
                VendorId (PK) 
                VendorName 
            hydvendors 
                VendorId(PK) 
                VendorName 
 
2. AllVendors table data                Hydvendors table data 
        1    Reliance                1   Bajaj 
        2    Bajaj                2   Sony 
        3    Sony                3   Reliance 
        4    Samsung 
        5    PI 
 
3. Create Inner Join 
 - It compares multiple tables and returns only the matching records. 
 - Condition is defined by using "ON". 
 
Ex: 
SELECT  allvendors.VendorId, allvendors.VendorName AS AllVendors,   
            hydvendors.VendorId, hydvendors.VendorName AS HydVendor 
        
        FROM allvendors INNER JOIN hydvendors ON                           
        
        allvendors.VendorName=hydvendors.VendorName; 
 
Inner Join        : It returns all matching records from both tables. 
Left Join            : It returns all records of left table and null in the right table when 
                  matching records not found. 
Right Join        : It returns all records of right table and null in the left table when 
                  matching records not found. 
Cross Join        : It returns null in both left and right tables when records mismatch. 
 
 
                          MySQL Views - A view represents virtual data table. - You can query data from tables and save the result as a view so that you can individually 
handle the result when ever required. - How ever the data in view is connected with source tables. - You can change the view but can't manipulate the data in view. - You can change only the query of view not the data. 
 
Syntax: 
    create view viewName as query; 
 
Ex: 
    create view  top_rated_products  AS   
    select * from tblproducts where  Rating >= 4; 
 
Ex: 
create view common_vendors AS 
select  allvendors.VendorName as AllVendors, hydvendors.VendorName as HydVendor 
from allvendors inner join hydvendors ON allvendors.VendorName=hydvendors.VendorName; 
 - You can access the view just like a table; 
 
    select * from  view_name; 
    select * from  common_vendors; 
 
MySQL Triggers - Trigger is a stored program similar to a procedure. - It comprises of commands that execute automatically when table is updated. - You can create a log of actions performed on tables. - So that you can track the actions on data. - Triggers are required to keep data integrity and log. 
 
Syntax: 
   CREATE TRIGGER  trigger_name 
   { BEFORE | AFTER }   { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE } 
   ON table_name 
   FOR Each ROW 
   BEGIN 
    .... statements.... 
   END 
 - BEFORE & AFTER defines when trigger need to execute. - INSERT, UPDATE & DELETE are the actions that execute trigger. - FOR EACH ROW specifies that trigger executes and updates changes after each row. - BEGIN, END is the scope that contains statements to execute. 
 
Ex: 
1. Create a new database table by name  tblstudents 
 
        Student_Id  (PK) Int  Not Null 
        Grade  varchar(10) 
 
2. Create a another database table to track and the data changes in students table 
    
        students_log   [table name] 
 
        Id  (PK)  INT   NOT NULL  AUTO_INCREMENT, 
        Action  Varchar(20), 
        Change_Time   TIMESTAMP  DEFAULT  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
        Student_Id  INT, 
        FOREIGN KEY  (Student_Id)  References tblStudents(Student_Id) 
 
Note: Constraint name is required only when the changes expected in 
      foreign key 
 
3. Create a trigger to track the changes in student table 
 
 
        DELIMITER // 
        Create trigger  track_students 
        After  Update ON  tblstudents 
        FOR EACH ROW 
        BEGIN 
 
             Insert into students_log (Student_Id, Action)  values 
             (NEW.id, 'Update'); 
 
        END // 
        DELIMITER; 
 
Ex: 
table-1: 
tblStudents 
    Student_Id  INT  PK   AUTO_INCREMENT 
    Grade  varchar(10) 
 
table-2: 
students_log 
    LogId            INT  PK   AUTO_INCREMENT 
    Action            Varchar(20), 
    Change_Time        TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
    Student_Id         INT 
    
    Foreign Key (Student_Id)  References  tblStudents(Student_Id) 
 
Trigger: 
 
DELIMITER // 
create trigger track_students 
after update ON tblstudents 
FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN 
   insert into students_log (Student_Id, Action) values (NEW.Student_Id, 'Update'); 
END// 
DELIMITER ; 
 
          
                                                  THE END MYSQL 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MONGODB 
MongoDB - It is open source and cross platform NON-SQL database. - It is document oriented and semi-structured database. - Document oriented allows to handle schema less content. - It supports ORM [Object Relational Mapping]. - ORM introduces features like  lazy loading, change tracking, identity resolution etc. - It supports AD-HOC querying. [Dynamic Queries] - It supports Indexing. [It doesn't require a primary key field] - It supports data replications, which enable to handle load. 
 
Issues with MongoDB: - It is structured less. - It is non-relational - It is not great for data predictions and analytics. 
 
Setup MongoDB in your PC: 
 
1. Download MongoDB Community Server 
 
        https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community 
 
2. Run the Installer on your PC and select  "MongoDB Compass"  while installing. 
 
 
3. Start MongoDB server from  "Services.msc" 
 
4. MongoDB server runs on following IP location 
 
    mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017 
            (or) 
    mongodb://localhost:27017 
 
5. Open MongoDB Compass on your PC. 
    [ It is a GUI tool for managing MongoDB] 
 
6. Create New Connection with following address 
 
            mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017 
 
7. Connect & Save 
 
                  MongoDB Terminology 
 
MySQL                        MongoDB ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Database     (Schema)            Database 
 
Tables                        Collections 
 
Record / Row                    Document 
 
Field                        Field [ Key ] 
 
Joins                        Embedded Documents 
 
 
Note: MongoDB Compass provides 
        a) GUI         : For handling database and its objects graphically.     
        b) Mongosh    : Mongo Shell, which is a CLI [command line tool]. 
 
 
                          Mongo Shell Commands 
 
1. To view existing databases 
 
        > show dbs 
 
     - The default databases on MongoDB server 
        a) admin 
        b) config 
        c) local 
 
2. To clear screen 
 
        > cls 
 
3. To recall the recently used commands  use  up & down arrows. 
MongoDB Shell 
    > show dbs 
    > cls 
 
4. To use an existing database or to create a new database Mongo Shell uses "use" 
command. 
 
        > use  databaseName 
 
    - If database exists it starts using it, else it can create a new database. 
    - MongoDB creates a temporary database by specified name. 
    - You can't view the new database in the list of databases, until you store some 
      data into database. 
 
        > db             
    
    - "db" command refers to current active database. 
 
        > use  sampledb        => new database name 
        > db                    => shows active database 
 
5. Creating a new collection 
    - MongoDB database stores data in collections. 
    - Collection represents a table of MySQL. 
    - You can create a new collection by using the method 
            "createCollection()" 
 
    Syntax: 
           > db.createCollection("name", { options }) 
           > db.createCollection("name") 
 
 
    - Table options is a key & value collection.   
            { Key : Value } 
 
    - MongoDB collection options are 
 
            Option            Description 
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
            autoIndexId        It is a Boolean option takes "true / false". 
                            It generates an auto generated Id for every document 
                            in collection. 
                            It is a unique document ID for every record. 
                            It is default set to "true". 
 
            size                It refers to the memory allocated for collection. 
                            It uses "bytes" as value. 
                            It is integer type. 
 
                            8 bits        = 1 byte 
                            1024 bytes    = 1 kb 
                            1024 kb        = 1 mb 
                            1024 mb        = 1 gb 
                            1024 gb        = 1 tb 
 
                            1024 x 1024 = 1048576  [1mb] 
                            1048576 * 2 =  2097152  [2mb] 
 
            max                It defines the maximum number of documents 
                            allowed. 
                            It is a number. 
 
 
            capped            It is a Boolean option, takes "true or false". 
                            If capped is set to true, you can't store more than the                                max 
limit. 
                            If capped is set to false then the new documents will 
                            replace the old. 
Syntax: 
    
> db.createCollection("name", { autoIndexId:true/false, size:0,  max:0, capped:true/false }) 
 
Ex: 
 
>db.createCollection("categories", {autoIndexId:true, size:2097152, max:5, capped:true }) 
 
6. To view the list of collections in database 
 
        > show collections 
 
7. To remove any collection you can use "drop()" method. 
    
Syntax: 
        > db.collectionName.drop() 
        
Ex: 
        > db.categories.drop() 
 
 
8. To remove any database you have to switch into the database and use the command 
        dropDatabase() 
 
Syntax: 
        > use databaseName 
        > db.dropDatabase()MongoDB Commands - Creating Database - Creating Collection - Collection Options 
 
FAQ's: 
1. How to identify capped collection? 
A. By using "isCapped()". It is a Boolean method that returns true if collection is capped. 
 
Syntax: 
    db.collectionName.isCapped(); 
 
2. How to change a normal collection to capped collection? 
A. By using  "db.runCommand()" with "convertToCapped" attribute. 
 
Syntax: 
    db.runCommand({ 'collectionName', convertToCapped: true }) 
 
3. Can we change the capped size and capped max length? 
A. Yes by using  "collMod" attribute with capped size and capped length. 
 
  Insert Data into Database Collection - MongoDB latest version recommends 
    a) insertOne() 
    b) insertMany() - Every document is JSON type. - JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. - The data type of fields are referred as "BSON" type. 
   [Binary Serialization Object Notation] 
 
FAQ: What is Serialization & De-Serialization? 
Ans:  The process of converting an object in to binary in order to transport via network 
         and store in a data source is known as "Serialization". 
 
      The process of converting an object to binary in order to read and display 
      is known as "Deserialization". 
 
                Writing    => Serialization 
                Reading    => Deserialization 
 - Object is a key and value collection, where key is string type and value can be any 
  BSON type. 
 
                { 
                  "key" : value 
                } 
 
Syntax: 
       db.collectionName.insertOne( { key : value, key : value } ) 
       db.collectionName.insertMany( [ {key: value }, {key : value} ]) 
 - The value type can be any one of the following BSON 
 - The commonly used types 
1. Number Type 
    - int, long, double, decimal 
 
    { 
       age : 22,  rate:4.5,  reviews: 560 
    } 
 
2. String Type 
    - single quote, double quote, backtick 
    - single quote is recommended 
 
    {     
      Name: 'John' 
    } 
 
3. Boolean Type 
    - It uses only "true or false" as value 
 
    { 
      Stock: true | false 
    } 
 
4. Null & Undefined 
    - If value is expected dynamically then set as null. 
    - If value is not defined statically then set as undefined. 
 
     { 
        Name: null, 
        Price: undefined 
    } 
 
5. Symbol 
    - It is used to configure a unique hidden field 
    - It is hidden over iterations but accessible individually. 
 
    { 
       Id : Symbol() 
    } 
 
 
6. Regular Expression 
    - It uses a set of meta characters and quantifiers enclosed in "/ /". 
 
    { 
       Mobile : /\+91\d{10}/ 
    } 
 
7. Array Type 
    - It is a sequential collection of values. 
    - It can have a collection of various data types. 
 
    { 
      values : [10, "A", true] 
    } 
 
    - It is always recommended to use only array meta character. "[ ]" 
 
 
8. Object Type 
    - It is a key and value collection. 
    - You can configure embedded objects. 
 
    { 
      rating : { rate: 4.5, count: 5600 } 
    } 
 
 
9. Date & Time 
    - BSON date is defined by using "$date" operator. 
    - It uses a date & time value as string. 
        
    { 
       mfd : {   
            $date: "yy-mm-dd hrs:min:sec.milliSec" 
             } 
    } 
 
 
Ex: Inserting single document 
 
    > db.categories.insertOne( { CategoryId: 1, CategoryName: "Electronics" } ) 
 
Ex: Inserting multiple documents 
 
    > db.categories.insertMany([{CategoryId:2, CategoryName:"Kids Fashion"}, {CategoryId:3, 
CategoryName:"Mens Fashion"}]) 
 
MongoDB Insert Documents - insertOne() - insertMany() - BSON 
 
Querying Documents from Collection - Create a new collection by name "products". - Visit the API   
        https://fakestoreapi.com/products - Copy data [JSON] - Open Notepad => Paste copied data => Save as  "data.json" - Go to MongoDB compass - Select collection "products" from your database. - Import from JSON => data.json 
 
            { 
              id: number, 
              title: string, 
              description: string, 
              image: string, 
              category: string 
              price: number 
              rating: {rate: number, count: number} 
            } - MongoDB provides "find()" method to find documents. - It requires a query defined as object. "{ key:value }" 
 
Syntax: 
        db.collectionName.find({ query }) 
        
Ex: 
        db.products.find({})            It returns all documents 
 - To query any specific document(s) it requires various operators or entities 
 
        $eq            Equal 
        $ne            Not Equal 
        $gt            Greater than 
        $gte            Greater than or equal 
        $lt            Less than 
        $lte            Less than or equal 
        $and        logical AND 
        $or            logical OR 
        $not            logical NOT 
 
Syntax: 
        db.collection.find({fieldname:value})      It returns exact match [1 or many] 
 
        db.categories.find({CategoryId:2}) 
 
        db.products.find({category: 'jewelery'}) 
 - If you want to query using any expression then it is defined as object. - The field name uses an object for expression. 
 
Syntax: 
        db.collection.find({field: { expression } }) 
 
Queries: 
1. Return all documents whose price is above 400 
 
    >db.products.find({price:{$gte:400}}) 
 
2. If your query is from an object field then you have to configure complete hierarchy in 
string format.   
    Return all products whose rating is above 4.5 [rating.rate] 
 
 
    > db.products.find({'rating.rate': {$gte:4.5 }}) 
 
3. Return the products with rating 4.5 
 
    > db.products.find({'rating.rate': 4.5}) 
    > db.products.find({'rating.rate': {$eq:4.5}}) 
 
 
4. Return the products that belong electronics and price is above 400. 
    - It requires logical AND with multiple expressions. 
    - Logical AND is defined using "$and" 
    - Multiple expressions are defined as "[ ]" array 
 
Syntax: 
    > db.collection.find({$and:[ {exp1}, {exp2}, ... ]}) 
 
    - It returns true only when all expressions evaluate to true. 
    
    > db.products.find({$and:[ {category:'electronics'}, {price:{$gte:400}} ]}) 
 
5. Return all products whose rating is between 3.0 & 4.6 
 
    > db.products.find({$and:[{'rating.rate':{$gte:3.0}},{'rating.rate':{$lte:4.6}}]}) 
 
 
6. Return all products whose category is jewelery and rating is between 3.0 & 4.6 
 
>db.products.find({$and:[{category:'jewelery'},{'rating.rate':{$gte:3.0}},{'rating.rate':{$lte:4.6}}]}) 
 
 
7. Return all jewelery and electronic products. 
 
> db.products.find({$or:[{category:'jewelery'},{category:'electronics'}]}) 
 
 
8. Return all jewelery and electronic products with rating above 4.5 
 
   (category==jewelery || category==electronics) && (rating.rate > =4.5) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FAQ: How to find values from array type? 
Ans : MongoDB provides "$all" operator to find values from array. 
 
Syntax: 
        {   
            id: 1, 
            category: "electronics", 
            title: "TV", 
            shippedTo: [ "Delhi", "Mumbai" ] 
        }, 
        { 
           .... 
           shippedTo: [ "Hyd", "Delhi" ] 
        } 
 
    > db.products.find({$all:{ shippedTo: ['Hyd', ..] }}) 
 
FAQ: How to find value in using date type? 
Ans:  Date type values are stored in ISO format. 
    
        { 
           "mfd": { 
                 "$date": "2025-01-22T00:00:00.000Z" 
                   } 
        } 
 
     You can search and find the date by using "ISODate()" method. 
 
       > db.collection.find({ mfd: ISODate("2025-01-22T00:00:00.000Z") }) 
 
                        
                       Updating Documents - MongoDB requires a find query to find the document and update. - Update can be 
    a) modifying document data 
    b) adding fields 
    c) renaming fields 
    d) removing fields etc.. - MongoDB update methods are 
    a) updateOne() 
    b) updateMany() - Update methods require operators 
    a) $set 
    b) $unset 
    c) $rename 
 
    $set            : It is used to change the value of any field. 
    $unset        : It removes a field 
    $rename        : It allows to change the field name. 
 
Syntax: 
    > db.collection.updateOne({find_query}, {update_query}) 
    > db.collection.updateMany({find_quer}, {update_query}) 
 
Ex: Change the price of product with id=2 
    
 > db.products.updateOne({id:2}, {$set: {price:50.53}}) 
  
Ex: Change the rating of product with id=2 
 
 > db.products.updateOne({id:2},{$set: {'rating.rate':4.9} }) 
 
Ex: Add stock field for all products with electronics category. 
 
 > db.products.updateMany({category:'electronics'}, { $set: {stock:true} }) 
 
Ex: Update rating to 4.5 for all electronics products with price above 400. 
 
> db.products.updateMany({$and:[{category:'electronics'},{price:{$gte:400}}]}, 
{$set:{'rating.rate':4.5}}) 
 
Ex: Update electronic and jewelery products by setting stock as true. 
 
> db.products.updateMany({$or:[{category:'jewelery'},{category:'electronics'}]}, 
{$set:{stock:true}}) 
 - You can change the field name by using "$rename" 
 
Syntax: 
     > db.collection.updateMany({find_query}, {$rename:{"old_name" : "new_name"}}) 
 
Ex: Find all electronics and change their field name "stock" to "instock" 
 
      >db.products.updateMany({category:'electronics'}, {$rename: {'stock': 'instock'}}) 
 - You can remove any field by using "$unset". 
 
    >db.collection.updateMany({find_query},{$unset:{"fieldName": " "}})

                    MongoDB Validation Schema - Validation is the process of verifying user input. - Validation is required to ensure that contradictory and unauthorized data is not get stored 
into database. - MongoDB provides "jsonSchema" to configure validation for collection. - JSON Schema uses "bson" types that verify the data type of value that you insert. - It uses "validator" object for validation 
 
Syntax: 
    > db.createCollection("name", { 
            validator:{ 
            $jsonSchema: { 
                bsonType: "object", 
                required: [ key1, key2, key3, ...], 
                properties: { 
                    fieldname: { bsonType: "datatype", description:"", validator:"" } 
                } 
            } 
           } 
     }) 
 
Ex: 
db.createCollection("users", { 
     validator: { 
        $jsonSchema:{ 
            bsonType:"object", 
            required:["UserName", "Age"], 
            properties:{ 
               UserName: { 
                        bsonType:"string", 
                        description:"User Name must be a string" 
                               }, 
               Age:{ 
                        bsonType:"int", 
                        minimum:15, 
                        maximum:30, 
                        description:"age 15 to 30 only" 
                 } 
                  }         // end of properties 
            }             // end of schema 
            }                 // end of validator 
        }                // end of options 
    ) 
 - Validation Schema is defined with "validator" 
 
    > db.collection("name", { validator: { } }) 
 - Validator uses "$jsonSchema", which is object type 
 
    > db.collection("name", { validator: { $jsonSchema: { } } }) 
 - Every schema have following keys 
        a) bsonType        : It is always object type for schema 
        b) required        : It defines the fields that are required [not value] 
        c) properties        : It is an object that configures validation for every field. 
 
    > db.collection("name", { 
        validator: { 
            $jsonSchema: { 
                 bsonType: "object", 
                 required: [ "fields.." ], 
                 properties: { 
 
                  } 
             } 
         } 
        }) - Every field validation is defined as object with bsontype, validator services & description. 
 
            properties: { 
                field : {     
                       bsonType: "datatype", 
                       minimum: value, 
                       maximum: value, 
                       required: true, 
                       description: "message" 
                    }, 
                 field: {  } 
            } 
 
Note: You can add new fields that are not defined in validator. But you can't ignore 
      the fields that are defined as required fields. 
 
FAQ: What is a clustered collection in MongoDB? 
Ans:  A clustered collection can have multiple indexes. 
     You can configure multiple unique key fields other than autoIndexId. 
     It is good for manipulations. 
     However it is slow in interactions when there are multiple unique keys in collection. 
 
Syntax: 
db.createCollection( 
   "collectionName", 
    { clusteredIndex: { "key": { id: 1 }, "unique": true, "name": "any description" } } 
) 
 
                                                           NODE JS 
 
Node JS 
Node JS is an open source and cross platform JavaScript runtime used by developers to build 
Web Applications, Servers, CLI tools and Scripts. 
 
FAQ: What is server side scripting? 
Ans:  Server Side Scripting is a technique where scripts are employed on server, 
      in order to generate response customized for every client request. 
 
      There are various server side scripting technologies like 
        a) PHP 
        b) ASP / ASP.NET 
        c) JSP 
        d) Node JS  etc. 
 - Node JS allows to write scripts on server side, so that they can configure a business 
logic that handle communication between client and database. 
 
Features of Node JS: 
1. It is JavaScript based. 
2. It is single threaded. 
    - It uses a single ton pattern. 
    - Object is created for first request and the same is used across requests. 
    - It manages memory by reducing overload. 
    - It improves performance of application. 
3. It is modular. 
    - Modular refers to "Part-by-Part". 
    - It configures application specific framework. 
    - It loads only what is required for the situation. 
    - It makes application light weight and faster. 
4. It is asynchronous. 
    - It uses unblocking technique. 
    - It can perform any task in background without blocking other tasks in memory. 
    - It improves performance of application. 
5. It will not use buffering. 
    - Data is received in the form of memory packets. 
    - So it is continuous without break. 
 
Issues - It is not good for multi threaded interactions that are required for application. - It is not good for application that requires lot of data caching. 
 
Note: Server Side scripting technology provides a set of server side objects and 
      techniques that are used to handle communication with client and data server. 
 
      Objects: 
         - Request 
         - Response 
          - Session 
         - Application 
         - Server 
         - File Stream etc.. 
 
      Techniques: 
         - Caching 
         - Routing 
         - Model Binding 
         - Event Binding etc.. 
 
Setup Server Side Node Application: 
 
1. Install Node JS on your PC. 
 
    https://nodejs.org/en 
 
2. Install VS code editor. 
 
3. Add a new folder for server side application 
 
        F:\server-app 
 
4. Open project folder in VS code 
 
5. Open terminal and run the following command 
 
        > npm  init  -y     
 
       - It generates package.json 
    
6. Setup language analysis tool "esLint" for JavaScript project. 
 
        > npm init @eslint/config@latest 
 
   ? Install  "eslint config" package :  yes 
   ? How would you like to use ESLint? To check syntax and find problems 
   ? What type of modules does your project use?  CommonJS 
   ? Which framework does your project use? None of these 
   ? Does your project use TypeScript? No 
   ? Where does your code run?  Select Browser & Node 
   ? Would you like to install eslint, global.. now? Yes 
   ? Which package manager do you want to use? npm 
 
7. It will install all supported libraries and generates configuration file 
 
        "eslint.config.mjs" 
 
Note: All supported library files are copied into "node_modules" folder. 
 
 
* Module Systems: - Application development requires 
    a) Language 
    b) Library 
    c) Framework - Language & Library can build application, but can't control application flow. - Framework can control application flow. - Library is a set of factories and factory is a set of values and functions. 
 
    value, function => Factory => Service => Application 
 - A library can be implements using 2 techniques 
 
    a) Legacy 
    b) Modular 
 - A legacy library imports everything into memory, but uses only few. It leads to memory 
overload and application is heavy. 
 - A modular library imports only the required content for state and situation. It makes the 
application light weight. 
 - JavaScript uses various module systems like 
    a) Common JS 
    b) UMD (Universal Module Distribution) 
    c) AMD (Asynchronous Module Distribution) 
    d) JavaScript Module [ES Module] etc.. 
 - The default module system of Node JS is "Common JS". It uses JavaScript V8 compiler. 
JavaScript OOP - Computer programming systems that are used for real-world application development are 
classified into following 
1. POPS 
2. OBPS 
3. OOPS 
POPS - Process Oriented Programming System - It is light weight and faster. - It can directly interact with hardware services. - It supports low level features. 
Ex: C, Pascal  etc. - Reusability and Extensibility issues - Dynamic memory issues 
OBPS - Object Based Programming System - Enables reusability & limited extensibility. - Supports dynamic memory. 
Ex: JavaScript, Visual Basic etc. - Extensibility issues - Code level security issues - No template mechanism 
OOPS - Object Oriented Programming System - Reusability - Extensibility - Code Level Security - Templates 
Ex: C++, Java, C# etc. - It is complex and tedious. - Can't directly interact with hardware services. - It will not support low level features. - It is heavy and slow. 
JavaScript Module - A module comprises of values, functions and classes. 
- You can create factory with module. - You can build an application by using modules. - Application with modules enable features like 
    a) Reusability 
    b) Extensibility 
    c) Maintainability 
    d) Testability - Every JavaScript file is considered as a module. 
 
            home.js 
        // values 
        // functions 
        // classes 
 
JavaScript Module System [ ES Module ] 
 - Browsers can use ES module system when script is configured with  MIME type as 
  "module". 
            <script type="module"> 
 
            </script> 
 - ES module requires "export" keyword in order to export any function or class from module. 
 
              export function Name() { } 
              export class Name() { } 
 - You have to use "import" keyword to import the functions or classes. 
 
              import  { functionName, className }  from  "moduleName"; 
 - Every module can have one "default" export. - A default export member enable eager loading of value and functions. 
 
              import  defaultName  from  "moduleName"; 
 - You can import all members from any module by using the meta character "*". It requires an alias 
name to access all imported members. 
 
 
              import  * as ref from "moduleName"; 
 
Note: You can't import default member using "*" meta character. 
      You can configure default along with all other members. 
 
            import  defaultMember, * as ref  from "moduleName"; 
 
Ex: 
1. Add a new folder  "src" 
 
2. Add new files into src folder 
    
        calculator.js 
        app.html 
 
calculator.js 
 
var title = "Calculator App"; 
 
export function PrintTitle(){ 
    return title; 
} 
 
export function Addition(a, b){ 
    return a + b; 
} 
 
export default function Multiply(a, b){ 
    return a * b; 
} 
 
app.html 
 
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en"> 
<head> 
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
    <title>Document</title> 
    <script type="module"> 
        import Multiply, * as cal from "./calculator.js"; 
        
        document.querySelector("h2").innerHTML = cal.PrintTitle(); 
        document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = `Addition=${cal.Addition(20, 
30)}<br>Multiply=${Multiply(2,5)}` 
    </script> 
</head> 
<body> 
    <h2></h2> 
    <p></p> 
</body> 
</html> 
 
JavaScript OOP - Modules - ES Module System - Export & Import 
 
 
  Common JS Module System - Module is a set of value, functions and classes. - CJS module refers to a JavaScript file with extension ".js or .cjs" - The members in module are marked with "exports" keyword. 
 
Syntax: 
        exports.refName = function() {   } 
 - You can import and use from any location by using "require()" method. 
 
Syntax: 
        const ref = require("./module_name");        "ref" can access all members 
        const ref = require("./module_name").functionName(); 
 - You have to compile and run JavaScript programs server side by using Node compiler. [ 
Node use google chrome v8 compiler ]. 
 
        > node  file.js 
 
Note: You can't use any of the BOM & DOM methods of JavaScript server side. 
      You can use JavaScript only as language server side. 
 
Ex: 
1. src/calculator.js 
 
var title = "Calculator App"; 
 
exports.PrintTitle = function(){ 
    return title; 
} 
 
exports.addition = function(a, b){ 
    return a + b; 
} 
 
exports.multiply = function(a, b){ 
    return a * b; 
} 
 
2. src/app.js 
 
const library = require("./calculator"); 
 
console.log(`${library.PrintTitle()}\nAddition=${library.addition(50,20)}`); 
 
 
 Class in OOP(already complete javascript) 
 
Class enables features like 
    a) Reusability 
    b) Separation 
    c) Extensibility 
    d) Testability etc. 
 
Class Members: - A class member can be any one of the following 
    a) Property 
    b) Accessor 
    c) Method 
    d) Constructor 
 
  Reusability & Extensibility 
   a) Aggregation 
   b) Inheritance 
   Polymorphism(charcter) 
 
 
 
Node Modules (pre-define module) 
 Node JS is a JavaScript runtime that provides various built-in modules for handling web  
applications, scripts, command line tools, servers etc. 
 
1. HTTP Module: - HTTP refers to "Hyper Text Transfer Protocol" - It configures a set of rules for creating web application and handling an application. - Node "http" module can "create a server". - It can configure a server side application. - It can handle request from client and send a customized response to client. 
 
Syntax: 
        const  http = require("http"); 
 - HTTP object provides a set of properties and methods that are used to handle server side 
application. 
 
        createServer()        : It is responsible for creating a new server. 
 
        STATUS_CODES    : It returns the status codes and status text of   
every                                   request. 
 
        METHODS        : It returns the HTTP Verbs like GET, POST, PUT etc. 
 
 
    HTTP Status Codes range from 100 to 500 
        1xx         : Related to process that defines request & response 
        2xx         : Related to confirmation. 
        3xx         : Related to redirection and actions on server. 
        4xx         : Related client side issues. 
        5xx         : Related to server side issues. 
 
   Http Methods refer to HTTP verbs that define the actions like 
        GET            : for fetching 
        POST         : for saving 
        PUT            : for updating 
        PATCH       : for partial update 
        DELETE      : for removing etc.. 
 
Creating Server: 
1. Http module provides "createServer()" to create a server object. 
 
    http.createServer(function(request, response){ 
 
 
    }) 
 
2. Request object is responsible for requesting the client data, which can be 
    - Query String 
    - Form Body 
    - Cookies etc. 
 
3. Response object is responsible for sending a response to client, which can be 
    - Text 
    - HTML 
    - File 
    - XML 
    - JSON etc. 
 
4. Response object provides various methods 
 
     a) writeHead()        It defines the type of content to send a response. 
     b) write()                It contains the chunk of response. The content to send. 
     c) end()                It ends the response. 
 
Syntax: 
      
    http.createServer(function(request, response){ 
 
        response.writeHead(statusCode, { content-type }); 
        response.write("content to send"); 
        response.end(); 
    }) 
 
    - Always response is sent to client when status code is 200 [OK]. 
 
5. Server starts using "listen()" method. 
 
      http.createServer().listen(port); 
 
      Port Numbers: 
            1 to 1023            Well known port numbers 
            1024 to 41591        Registered port numbers 
            41592 to 65565    Dynamic port numbers 
 
Ex: 
  index.js 
 
const http = require("http"); 
 
http.createServer((req, res)=>{ 
     res.writeHead(200, {'content-type':'text/html'}); 
     res.write("<h2>Welcome to Node JS</h2><p>HTML response sent from server</p>"); 
     res.end(); 
}).listen(4040); 
console.log(`Server Started: http://127.0.0.1:4040`); 
 
> node index.js 
 
    http://localhost:4040 
           (or) 
    http://127.0.0.1:4040 
 
 
Ex: JSON Response 
 
const http = require("http"); 
 
http.createServer((req, res)=>{ 
     res.writeHead(200, {'content-type':'application/json'}); 
     res.write(JSON.stringify([{Name:'TV', Price:45000},{Name:'Mobile', Price:12000}])); 
     res.end(); 
}).listen(4040); 
console.log(`Server Started: http://127.0.0.1:4040`); 
 
Node Http Module(previous learnt) - Creating Server - Handling Request - Sending Response 
 
 
  Connection with Backed Database - Node JS requires a middleware to communicate with backend database. - Node JS uses database drivers as middleware tools to connect with backend database. - Middleware is a software that handle communication in network based application. - Database drivers provide various properties and methods to communicate with database. - Every database requires different set of drivers. 
 
   http://seshajobs.com/ 
 
 
Connection with MongoDB Database: - Node JS can use 2 types of libraries to communicate with MongoDB. 
    a) MongoDB Driver 
    b) Mongoose (library) 
 - MongoDB driver provides a set of properties and methods to communicate with MongoDB 
database. It uses a traditional database first approach. 
 - Mongoose uses object modeling and can implement ORM. [Object Relational Mapping]. 
 
Note: MongoDB latest drivers mangoose library provides promise based functions and 
      supports ORM. 
 
MongoDB Drivers for Node JS: 
1. Install MongoDB drivers for project 
 
        > npm  install  mongodb --save 
 
2. MongoDB module provides server and client classes, you have to import 
    "MongoClient" class. 
 
    - Server classes are for administration 
    - Client classes are for communication 
 
Syntax: 
    const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
 
3. MongoClient class provides a "connect()" method to connect with MongoDB server. 
 
Syntax: 
 
     mongoClient.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017") 
    .then(()=>{ 
        console.log("connected.."); 
    }) 
    .catch(()=>{ 
        console.log("Unable to connect"); 
    }) 
 
    - connect() is a JavaScript promise, which is asynchronous in request. 
    - It returns a client object on resolve. [then] 
    - It returns an error object on reject. [catch] 
 
Syntax: 
        mongoClient.connect(url).then(clientObject=>{}).catch(error=>{}).finally() 
 
Ex: 
 test.js 
 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
mongoClient.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017").then(clientObject=>{ 
    console.log(`Connection Success..`); 
}).catch(error=>{ 
    console.log(error); 
}) 
 
4. You have configure connection with a database on server using client object. 
 
    
Syntax:     
    mongoClient.connect("url").then(clientObject=>{ 
 
        var database = clientObject.db("databaseName"); 
    
    }) 
 
5. You have to communicate with any collection in database by using collection() method. 
 
Syntax: 
         database.collection("collectionName").find() 
                                          .insertOne() 
                                          .deleteOne() 
                                          .updateOne() etc.. 
 
 
6. The find() method returns document(s) on success. If query returns multiple documents 
then convert it into array by using "toArray()". 
 
 
Syntax: 
          database.collection("name").find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
 
          }) 
 
 
Ex: 
test.js 
 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
mongoClient.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017").then(clientObject=>{ 
      var database =  clientObject.db("sampledb"); 
      database.collection("categories").find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
          console.log(documents); 
      }) 
}); 
 
Ex: Connection with backend database using client request 
 
index.js 
 
const http = require("http"); 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
http.createServer((req, res)=>{ 
 
     res.writeHead(200, { 'content-type': 'application/json' }); 
 
     mongoClient.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017").then(clientObject=>{ 
 
          var database = clientObject.db("sampledb"); 
 
          database.collection('products').find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
               res.write(JSON.stringify(documents)); 
               res.end(); 
          }); 
 
     }); 
 
 
}).listen(5050); 
console.log(`Server Started http://127.0.0.1:5050`); 
Note: To return any specific document you can use  "findOne()". It returns the first occurrence 
document that match given condition. 
 
Syntax: 
     database.collection("products").findOne({id:2}).then(document=>{ 
        console.log(document); 
    }) 
 
    To return multiple documents you can use "find()" with "toArray()". 
 
Syntax: 
    database.collection("products").find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
        console.log(documents); 
    }) 
 
 
Ex: 
index.js 
 
const http = require("http"); 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
http.createServer((req, res)=>{ 
 
     res.writeHead(200, { 'content-type': 'application/json' }); 
 
     mongoClient.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017").then(clientObject=>{ 
 
          var database = clientObject.db("sampledb"); 
 
          database.collection('products').findOne({id:2}).then(document=>{ 
                res.write(JSON.stringify(document)); 
                res.end(); 
          }); 
 
     }); 
 
 
}).listen(5050); 
console.log(`Server Started http://127.0.0.1:5050`); 
 
Ex: Inserting Document 
test.js 
 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
mongoClient.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017").then(clientObject=>{ 
      var database =  clientObject.db("sampledb"); 
      
      var category = { 
         CategoryId:5, 
         CategoryName: "Women Fashion" 
      } 
 
      database.collection("categories").insertOne(category).then(()=>{ 
          console.log('Record Inserted'); 
      }); 
 
 
}); 
 
Ex: Updating Document 
 
test.js 
 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
mongoClient.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017").then(clientObject=>{ 
      var database =  clientObject.db("sampledb"); 
      
      database.collection("categories").updateOne({CategoryId:3},{$set:{CategoryName:'Kids 
Accessories'}}).then(()=>{ 
         console.log("Record Updated.."); 
      }) 
 
 
}); 
 
 
Ex: Deleting Document 
test.js 
 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
mongoClient.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017").then(clientObject=>{ 
      var database =  clientObject.db("sampledb"); 
      
      database.collection("categories").deleteOne({CategoryId:5}).then(()=>{ 
           console.log("Record Deleted"); 
      }) 
 
 
});

    var database = clientObject.db("shopping"); 
 
    database.collection("products").insertOne({Id:2, Name:'Mobile', Price:12000.44}).then(()=>{ 
        console.log(`Record Inserted `); 
    }); 
 
 
}); 
 
                          Async Techniques - JavaScript provides "async" and "await" to configure actions using unblocking technique. - Unblocking will not block other tasks while performing the specified. 
 
Syntax: 
        async function name() 
        { 
           return  await value; 
        } 
 
Mongoose for MongoDB - Mongoose is an "Object Modeling Tool". - It provides an asynchronous environment for communication with MongoDB database. - The async functions of mongoose allows to handle interactions using unblocking 
techniques. 
 - Install mongoose for your project

NODE EVENT 
1.What is Event? 
A. Event is a message sent by sender to its subscriber in order to notify change. 
 
2. What is event pattern? 
A. Event follows a software design pattern called "Observer". It is a communication pattern. 
Event uses delegate mechanism "function pointer". 
 
3. What is event handler? 
A. Event handler defines the action to be performed. It is a trigger for event. 
 
        onclick            : Event 
        onclick="Name()"    : Event Handler 
 
4. What is event listener? 
A. It configures event for component dynamically. 
    Listener have a trigger and action to perform. 
    You can add listener or remove listener dynamically. 
 
5. What is Event Emitter? 
A. Event Emitter is the base class for all events. 
    Every event is derived from event emitter base. 
 
Configuring Server Side Events: 
1. Import the events module 
 
     const  events = require("events"); 
 
2. Create a new object for EventEmitter class. 
 
    let  event = new EventEmitter(); 
 
3. Configure a function that works as a Subscriber, It is a  function that defines actions 
     to perform when event is triggered. 
 
    let  handleName = function() { 
 
    } 
 
 
4. Register event by using  "on()" method 
 
      event.on("eventName", handleName); 
 
      It uses addEventListener and registers a new event by specified name. 
      Every event requires a handler function. 
 
5. Event is executed by using "emit()" method. 
 
      event.emit("eventName"); 
 
 
Ex: 
const events = require("events"); 
 
let event = new events.EventEmitter(); 
 
let handlerName = function(){ 
     console.log(`Event Executed Successfully..`); 
} 
 
event.on('send', handlerName);          //onsend="handlerName" 
event.emit('send'); 
 
Ex: 
test.js 
 
const events = require("events"); 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
 
let event = new events.EventEmitter(); 
 
let handlerName = function(){ 
     mongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017').then(clientObj=>{ 
         var database = clientObj.db("sampledb"); 
         database.collection('categories').find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
             console.log(documents); 
         }) 
     }) 
} 
 
event.on('send', handlerName);          //onsend="handlerName" 
event.emit('send'); 
 
 
FAQ: What is difference between  addEventListener() & on()? 
Ans:  addEventListener is just an alias of "on()". 
 
Syntax: 
      event.addEventListener('eventName',handleName).emit('eventName'); 
 
Ex: 
const events = require("events"); 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
 
let event = new events.EventEmitter(); 
 
 
 
let handlerName = function(){ 
     mongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017').then(clientObj=>{ 
         var database = clientObj.db("sampledb"); 
         database.collection('categories').find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
             console.log(documents); 
         }) 
     }) 
} 
 
event.addListener('send', handlerName).emit('send');

                                Routing - Routing enables navigation in application. - Routing is a technique used in web application to configure user and SEO friendly URL's. - Routing can be implemented client side and server side. - Server side routes are used to configure request and response. - A route can handle request from client and send a customized response. 
 
Route Flow: 
- A client request is sent to web server. - A Http Handler validates the request and sends to Routing Engine. - Routing Engine verifies the requested path by comparing with the path defined in application 
Route Table. - If requested path is matching then it send a response to client request. - If path mismatch then it sends an error page with HTTP status code. 
 
Configuring Routes: - Every route comprises of a request path and callback function. 
 
Syntax: 
        app.get("path", function() { });   // path:request path  function(){}: callback () 
 - Path comprises of entities and wild cards 
 
    "/"            It executes when user request is not for any specific. 
    "*"            It executes when requested path mismatch. [not found] 
    "/name"        It executes when requested path exactly matches with given name 
    "/colou?r"        It executes when requested path is matching regular expression 
 - The callback function comprises of various objects, the primary are 
        a) request 
        b) response 
 - A request object can request content from client, which includes 
        request.query            => query string 
        request.cookies        => cookies 
        request.body            => form body 
        request.params        => route parameters 
        etc.. 
 - A response object can send customized response to client, which includes 
  file, plain text, html, JSON, XML etc. 
 
        response.json()        => specific JSON response 
        response.send()        => any type of response 
        response.end()        => end the response 
 
Ex: 
index.js 
 
const express = require("express"); 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
let app = express(); 
 
app.get('/', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send('<h2>Welcome to Express JS</h2>'); 
}); 
 
app.get('/mobiles', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send([{Name:'iPhone 16'}, {Name:'Samsung'}]); 
}); 
 
app.get('/c*t', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send('You requested path that uses Regular expression'); 
}); 
 
app.get('/products', (req, res)=>{ 
     mongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017').then(clientObj=>{ 
           var database = clientObj.db("sampledb"); 
           database.collection("products").find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
                res.send(documents); 
                res.end(); 
           }) 
     }) 
}); 
 
app.get('/path',(req, res)=>{ 
      
}) 
 
app.get('*', (req, res)=>{ 
     res.send('404 - Requested Path Not Found'); 
}); 
 
app.listen(3030); 
console.log(`Server Started http://127.0.0.1:3030`); 
 
Express JS Framework - Create Server Side App - Routing - Wild Card Routes 
 
 Route Parameters - A route parameter allows to query any content directly from URL. - Parameter is defined in route path. - The values are configured in URL. - You can access route parameters using "request" object. 
 
Syntax: 
       app.get('/path/:param1/:param2', ( req, res ) => { 
 
       }) 
 
      http://server.com/value1/value2 
 
        param1=value1 
        param2=value2 
 
     req.params = { param1:value1, param2:value2} 
 
     req.params.param1;        // value1 
 
Without Route Params: 
 
   http://localhost:3030/products?id=1&name=tv&price=50000 
 
With Route Params: 
 
   http://localhost:3030/products/1/tv/50000

 API(Application Programming Interface) 
 
1. Distributed Computing 
   - It allows communication between two applications running on two different devices. 
   - It also allows communication between two objects running in two different process of 
same machine. 
 
2. Distributed Computing Technologies 
 
    CORBA         
    - Common Object Request Broken Architecture 
    - 14+ languages C++, Java etc. 
 
    DCOM 
    - Distribute Component Object Model 
    - Visual Basic Language 
    
    RMI 
    - Remote Method Invocation 
    - J2EE 
 
    EJB 
    - Enterprise Java Beans 
    - Java 
 
    Web Service 
    - All technologies know web service 
    - PHP, JSP, ASP etc. 
 
    Remoting 
    - It is used by .NET technology 
 
3. Web Service 
      - It is distributed computing technology used in all language. 
    - Introduced by W3C [World Wide Web Consortium] 
 
4. Communication Specification 
 
    a) SOAP 
    b) REST 
    c) JSON 
 
    SOAP 
    - Service Oriented Architecture Protocol. 
    - Consumer will send an XML request. 
        
            <Products> 
                <Product> 
                  <Category> Electronics </Category> 
                </Product> 
            </Products> 
 
    - Provider will send an XML response. 
 
            <Products> 
                <Product> 
                    <Id>1</Id> 
                    <Name>TV</Name> 
                    <Category>Electronics</Category> 
                </Product> 
                .... 
                .... 
            </Products> 
 
 
    REST 
        - Representational State Transfer 
        - Consumer sends a simple query request 
 
            http://server.com/products?category=electronics 
    
        - Provider sends an XML or JSON response. 
        
     JSON 
        - JavaScript Object Notation 
        - Consumer sends JSON request 
 
            { 
              category: "electronics" 
            } 
 
        - Provider sends JSON response 
 
            [ 
              {  Id:1, Name:'TV', Category: 'electronics' } 
               .... 
            ] 
 
 
5. Issues with Web Service 
    - It uses SOAP as communication specification. 
    - XML request & response 
    - It runs only on HTTP protocol. 
    - It runs only on Web Server. 
 
6. Web API 
    - Application Programming Interface 
    - It is an alternative for Web Service 
    - It uses REST & JSON. 
    - It can work on various protocols. 
    - It can run on various servers. 
 
Note : API allows to reach any device and any OS service.

Various Communication Specification 
    - SOAP 
    - REST 
    - JSON 
 
  API - Application Programming Interface - It provides a business logic that enable communication between client, server and database. - It can make the data available for any device or any OS service. - API uses XML & JSON format of data.(for transformation) - It can run on any server and any protocol. 
 
FAQ: Why XML & JSON? - Light weight - Faster - Cross platform - Not infected with VIRUS [Vital Information Under Seized] - Not blocked by firewalls. [Flow through firewall] - Doesn't require COM to Marshal. [Common Object Model] 
  [object-binary-object] - Data is secured 
 
 
Creating API using Node & Express JS: 
 
1. Install following libraries & framework 
 
        > npm  install  express   --save 
        > npm  install  cors  --save 
        > npm  install mongodb --save 
 
    express        : It is a middleware framework for creating API's 
    CORS        : Cross Origin Resource Sharing, It enables and disables 
                  various HTTP requests. 
    mongodb        : It database driver for mongodb connection. 
 
2. Add a new file 
      api.js 
const express = require("express"); 
const cors = require("cors"); 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
const constr = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017";

                        Express Static Resources - A server side application designed using Node & Express comprises of API routes. - It can respond to the requests and server the routes. - It can't access other static resources like CSS, HTML, SCSS, Images, Docs etc. - You have to configure static resources for server side app by using 
    "express.static()" method. 
 
Syntax: 
 
    const express = require("express"); 
    
    const app = express(); 
 
    app.use(express.static("public")); 
 
 
Ex: 
1. Add a new folder "public" with "index.html". 
2. Add script file into root level by name "index.js" 
3. You can configure static resources and API's.

    <script> 
        function bodyload(){ 
            fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:4040/categories`) 
            .then(response=> response.json()) 
            .then(categories=>{

</head> 
<body onload="bodyload()"> 
    <h1>Index</h1> 
    <select> 
 
    </select> 
</body> 
</html> 
 
5. Run your Index.js 
 
    > node   index.js 
 
        http://localhost:4040        => serves index.html 
 
                
  JSON Server(create fake api) - It configures a local server with Data and API's. - Data is locally maintained in a JSON file. - API's are generated implicitly for the data designed in JSON. - API routes are implicitly configured for handling all request like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc. 
 
1. Install JSON server globally on your device 
 
        C:\> npm  install  -g   json-server 
 
2. Go to your application physical path and add a new JSON file for data 
 
              "db.json" 
 
    { 
      "categories": [ { }, { } ], 
      "products": [ { }, { } ], 
      "users": [ { }, { } ] 
    } 
 
Note: Every record in data comprises of "id" as primary key. 
 
 
3. Start JSON server 
 
     >json-server  db.json  --watch  --port=5050 
 
4. API end points are auto generated 
 
      http://localhost:5050/categories            GET all categories 
                       /categories/1        GET specific category 
                       /categories             POST into categories 
                       /categories/1        PUT into categories 
                      /categories/1            DELETE from categories 
 
 
  Express Error Handling - Errors in application are categorized into 2 types 
    a) Compile Time Errors 
    b) Run Time Errors - Compile time errors refer to syntactical errors in code. If any compile time error occurs then 
the application fails to run or start. - Run time errors occurs when compiler is unable to understand the instructions provided to 
application while using the application. - If any runtime error occurs then it leads to "Abnormal Termination" of application. - You can prevent abnormal termination using Exception handling. - The statements used for handling exceptions are 
 
        a) try        It is monitoring block, contains statements to execute. 
        b) catch        It is handler block, catches the error. 
        c) throw        It can throw exception explicitly 
        d) finally        It contains statements to execute always 
 
Error Handling in Express: - Express provides promise based functions that report errors on reject. - Reject executes when there is any issues in the request. - Express request methods provides 
    a) request 
    b) response 
    c) next - Next is derived from "NextFunction". - It provides various functionalities like differToRoute and catch the errors. - It can report the errors to express. 
 
Syntax: 
    app.get("route", (req, res, next)=>{ 
 
          // configure the actions 
          res.end(); 
          next(error); 
    }) 
 - Next function returns errors to express which you can catch using  debugger. 
 
Setup Debugger for Express: 
 - Express provides a debugger to test all the route actions defined in application. - It tracks the routes and reports the errors. 
 
Syntax: 
         >set  DEBUG=express:* & node api.js 
 
 - It will start tracking the request and shows the tracking details. - However if any issue occurred in application at runtime, it will terminate the application. - You have to make sure that you are handling exceptions using catch() for every API request. 
 
Syntax: 
   app.get("/path", (req, res, next) =>{ 
 
        mongoClient.connect("url").then(clientObject=>{ 
 
         }) 
         .catch(error=>{     
            next(error); 
         }) 
   }) 
 - Next method can send only specific error details, which include 
    a) name 
    b) message 
 
Syntax: 
        .catch(error=>{ 
            next(`${error.name} : ${error.message`); 
        }) 
 
Ex: 
api.js 
 
const express = require("express"); 
const cors = require("cors"); 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
 
const constr = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"; 
 
const app = express(); 
app.use(cors()); 
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true})); 
app.use(express.json()); 
 
app.use(express.static("public")); 
 
app.get('/categories', (req, res, next)=>{ 
    mongoClient.connect(constr).then(clientObj=>{ 
         var database = clientObj.db("sampledb"); 
         database.collection("categories").find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{

jQuery - It is a JavaScript library. - Library comprises of pre-defined functions. - So that you can "write-less & do more". - It is light weight and faster. - It is CSS compliant. - It is cross browser compatible. - "John Resig" introduced jQuery in 2006. 
 
1. Install jQuery for project 
 
    > npm  install  jquery  --save 
 
2. jQuery library file is  "jquery.js", you have to link with your web page. 
 
    <script  src="../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js"> </script> 
 
3. jQuery library is configured using "$" directive. 
 
4. All jQuery functions are defined in an anonymous function. 
 
            $()        => invoke jQuery functions 
 
5. It uses a callback function that defines the scope of jQuery. 
 
            $(function(){ 
 
                // jQuery logic 
 
            }) 
 
 
Selecting HTML elements: 
 
- jQuery uses all CSS selectors to select elements. - You can use 
    a) Type Selector 
    b) Id Selector 
    c) Class Selector 
    d) Dynamic Pseudo Classes etc. 
 
Syntax: 
     <h1> </h1> 
     <p id="p1"> </p> 
     <div class="msg"> </div> 
 
      $("h1") 
      $("#p1") 
      $(".msg") 
      $("nav span") 
      $("h1+p") 
      $("p[id]") 
      $("input[type=text]") 
      etc.. 
 
jQuery DOM methods: 
    text()        It is similar to innerText or textContent 
    html()        It is similar to innerHTML 
    val()            It gets and sets value into element. 
    attr()            It gets the attribute of element 
    prop()        It gets the property of element 
    css()        It sets styles dynamically for element 
    before()        It adds new element before the selected. 
    after()        It adds new element after the selected. 
    prepend()    It adds as prefix 
    append()        It adds as suffix 
    appendTo()    It adds to specific element. 
    etc.. 
 
Syntax: 
    $("p").html("<b> Welcome </b>"); 
    $("h1").text("Welcome"); 
 
    <input type="text" id="UserName"> 
 
    $("#UserName").val() 
    $("#UserName").val("John") 
 
Note: jQuery uses JavaScript as language. 
        - Variables 
        - Data Types 
        - Operators 
        - Statements 
        - Functions 
        - Classes 
        - DOM & BOM methods

jQuery Events 
Event Handling in jQuery - jQuery uses all JavaScript browser events. - jQuery adds a listener for elements. - Listener uses a callback with event as argument. 
 
Syntax: 
     <button  id="btn"> 
 
     $("#btn").click(function(event){ 
 
          event.clientX; 
          event.clientY; 
          event.target.id; 
          event.target.name; 
          .... 
     }) 
 
Ex: 
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en"> 
<head> 
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
    <title>Document</title> 
    <script src="../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script> 
    <script> 
        $(()=>{ 
              
             $("#btnInsert").click((e)=>{ 
                   $("p").text(`Record Inserted into ${$("#lstDatabase").val()} Database`); 
                   console.log(`Button Id=${e.target.id}\nX=${e.clientX}`); 
             }); 
 
             $("#lstDatabase").change(()=>{ 
                  $("p").text(`${$("#lstDatabase").val()} Selected`); 
             }); 
 
        }) 
    </script> 
</head> 
<body> 
    <select id="lstDatabase"> 
        <option>Select Database</option> 
        <option>Oracle</option> 
        <option>MySQL</option> 
        <option>MongoDB</option> 
    </select> 
    <button id="btnInsert">Insert</button> 
    <p></p> 
</body> 
</html> 
 
Note: You can't add event listener for elements that are dynamically generated by using 
      selectors. It requires to search for element in document and add listener. 
 
Syntax: 
      $(document).on("event", "selector", function(event){ 
 
      }) 
 
Ex:     
      $(document).on("click", "#btn", (e)=>{ 
 
       })

jQuery Ajax - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML . - It enables partial post back. - You can add new details into page without reloading the page. - AJAX in browser is managed by using XMLHttpRequest object. - JavaScript can use 
    a) XMLHttpRequest 
    b) fetch() - jQuery provides Ajax methods with more features 
    * It is default async. 
    * It is good in error handling. 
    * It provides a complete life cycle methods to track every phase of request. 
    * It returns data in native format of data source. 
    * Conversions not required. 
    * It is good in handling CORS. 
 - jQuery Ajax methods include 
 
    $.ajax() 
    $.getJSON() 
    .ajaxSuccess() 
    .ajaxError() 
    .ajaxComplete() 
    .ajaxStart() 
    .ajaxEnd() 
    etc. 
 
Syntax: 
        $.ajax({ 
            method: "get | post | put | patch | delete", 
            data: "data_to_submit", 
            success: function(){ }, 
            url: "api_route", 
            error: function(){ } [failure] 
        }) 
 - The success function returns response object that comprises of response data. - The failure function returns error object that comprises of error details.

 - jQuery Ajax provides various life cycle methods to track the request and identify issues in 
every phase. It have a sequential order of processing requests 
 
        1st         ajaxStart() 
        2nd        ajaxSuccess() 
        3rd        ajaxComplete() 
        4th        ajaxEnd() 
        5th        ajaxError() 
 - Every life cycle method returns 2 objects 
    a) event 
    b) XMLHttpRequest - XMLHttpRequest object is referred as  "jqXHR", which contains 
    a) status 
    b) statusText 
    c) error  etc.

SASS(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet) - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet - Sass is a language used by developers to handle issues of CSS like 
    a) Reusability 
    b) Extensibility 
    c) Maintainability 
    d) Testability etc. - Sass is a CSS pre-processor. - Browser or webpage can't understand Sass. - Sass is trans compiled to CSS. 
 
Setup Environment for Sass: 
 
1. Install sass globally on your PC 
 
    C:\> npm  install  -g  sass 
 
    C:\> sass  --version        // to check version 
 
2. You have to create a new folder by name "sass / scss" in your project. 
 
3. Sass files are saved with extension ".scss" 
 
            index.scss 
 
        // code is written by using Sass commands & statements 
        // It is CSS compatible. 
 
4. Trans compile the sass code into CSS file 
 
    D:\your_project\sass> sass  index.scss  index.css --watch 
 
    --watch         It is a flag for continously monitoring the changes in Scss and 
                up date into css. 
 
Note: If watch is not defined the every change in scss must be re-compiled. 
 
5. Link "index.css" to your webpage. 
 
<head> 
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css"> 
</head> 
 
                       Sass Language Features 
 
1. Hierarchy of elements reference 
 - CSS have to use lot of rational or relational selectors to select child and adjacent 
elements. - Sass allows to write in the same hierarchy how you defined in HTML page. 
 
Syntax: 
        .parent { 
 
            // parent styles 
        
            .child { 
                // child styles 
            } 
 
        } 
 
Ex: 
 index.scss 
 
.alert { 
    border:2px solid red; 
    background-color: rgb(246, 214, 214); 
    padding: 20px; 
    border-radius: 10px; 
    h2 { 
        color:rgb(160, 0, 0); 
    } 
    p { 
        color:red; 
    } 
    a { 
        text-decoration: none; 
        color:rgb(171, 3, 3); 
    } 
} 
 
index.html 
 
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en"> 
<head> 
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
    <title>Document</title> 
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css"> 
</head> 
<body> 
    <div class="alert"> 
        <h2>Record Deleted</h2> 
        <p> Record deleted successfully.. </p> 
        <a href="#">Help?</a> 
    </div> 
    
</body> 
</html> 
 
2. Variables - Variables are storage locations in memory where you can store a value and use as a part 
of any expression. - Sass variables are declared by using "$" reference. 
 
Syntax: 
        $variableName : value; 
 - The value stored in a variable is of CSS value types 
        a) color name 
        b) units 
        c) hexadecimal 
        d) method names  [ rgb(), hsl() ] 
            etc.. 
 - Variables are accessed and used with styles using "$" reference. 
 
    { 
       color : $variableName; 
       border: 2px solid $variableName; 
    } 
 - Variable scope is classified into 2 types 
 
    a) Global     
    b) Block Level 
 - Global variable is declared at module level. - Block level is configured in a block and accessible in a closure. 
 
Ex: 
 index.scss 
 
$themeColor : rgb(0, 160, 3); 
$bgcolor : rgb(222, 246, 214); 
$themeSpace : 20px; 
.alert { 
    border:2px solid $themeColor; 
    background-color: $bgcolor; 
    padding: $themeSpace; 
    border-radius: $themeSpace; 
    h2 { 
        color:$themeColor; 
    } 
    p { 
        color:$themeColor; 
    } 
    a { 
        text-decoration: none; 
        color:$themeColor; 
    } 
    button { 
        margin-top: $themeSpace; 
        padding: 5px; 
        background-color: $themeColor; 
        color:white; 
        border:none; 
        width: 50px; 
    } 
} 
 
 
index.html 
 
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en"> 
<head> 
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
    <title>Document</title> 
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css"> 
</head> 
<body> 
    <div class="alert"> 
        <h2>Record Deleted</h2> 
        <p> Record deleted successfully.. </p> 
        <a href="#">Help?</a> 
        <div> 
        <button>OK</button> 
        </div> 
    </div> 
    
</body> 
</html> 
 
3. Mixin - A mixin is just like a method in programming. - It is used to refactor the code. - Refactoring allows to reuse the code without rewriting. 
 
Syntax: 
    @mixin   Name() 
    { 
    } 
 - @mixin is a directive used to configure a method. - Mixin is always void type. - A mixin name is used as reference name to access the block of code. - Mixin is imported in used in various locations using "@include" directive. 
 
Syntax: 
    @include  Name(); 
 - It can be parameter less or parameterized. - Parameters allows to modify the mixin. - If mixin is parameterized then you have to define values for all parameters while 
including a mixin. 
 
Syntax: 
       @mixin Name($param1, $param2) 
        { 
    
        } 
 
        @include  Name(value1, value2); 
 
Ex: 
index.scss 
 
$themeColor : rgb(0, 160, 3); 
$bgcolor : rgb(222, 246, 214); 
$themeSpace : 20px; 
 
@mixin box-model($borderColor, $bgcolor, $space) 
{ 
    border: 4px solid $borderColor; 
    background-color: $bgcolor; 
    padding: $space; 
    border-radius: $space; 
} 
 
.alert { 
    @include box-model(green, rgb(207, 241, 207), 20px); 
    h2 { 
        color:$themeColor; 
    } 
    p { 
        color:$themeColor; 
    } 
    a { 
        text-decoration: none; 
        color:$themeColor; 
    } 
    button { 
        margin-top: $themeSpace; 
        padding: 5px; 
        background-color: $themeColor; 
        color:white; 
        border:none; 
        width: 50px; 
    } 
} 
 
4. Sass Functions - Function is used to build any expression. - Expression evaluates and returns a value. - Sass function always returns a value. 
 
Syntax: 
    @function Name(params) 
    { 
       @return  value | expression; 
    } 
 - Function is accessed by using its reference name. 
 
Syntax: 
       { 
         property : Name(value); 
      } 
 
Ex: 
index.scss 
 
$themeColor : rgb(0, 160, 3); 
$bgcolor : rgb(222, 246, 214); 
$themeSpace : 5px; 
 
@function setFontSize($newSize){ 
    @return $newSize / 4; 
} 
 
@function RotateText($angle){ 
    @return $angle - 20; 
} 
 
@mixin box-model($borderColor, $bgcolor, $space) 
{ 
    border: 4px solid $borderColor; 
    background-color: $bgcolor; 
    padding: $space; 
    border-radius: $space; 
} 
 
.alert { 
    @include box-model(green, rgb(207, 241, 207), 20px); 
    h2 { 
        color:$themeColor; 
        font-size: setFontSize(300) + px; 
        transform: rotate(RotateText(25deg)); 
    } 
    p { 
        color:$themeColor; 
    } 
    a { 
        text-decoration: none; 
        color:$themeColor; 
    } 
    button { 
        margin-top: $themeSpace; 
        padding: 5px; 
        background-color: $themeColor; 
        color:white; 
        border:none; 
        width: 50px; 
    } 
}

5. Sass Statements - Statements are used to control the execution flow. - Sass provides 
    a) Decision Making 
    b) Iteration / Looping 
 
 
Decision Making: - Sass uses "@if" statement to handle decisions. - It is used to execute a set of statement when the condition evaluates to true. - You can configure "@else" clause to define statements to execute when condition 
evaluates to false. - It supports 
    a) simple decision 
    b) forward jump 
    c) multi level 
    d) multiple 
 
Syntax: 
    @if (condition1) 
     { 
         // effects on true; 
     } 
    @else if (condition2) 
     { 
         // effects on condition2 true; 
     } 
    @else 
    { 
        // effects on false; 
    }

$themeName : "success"; 
 
@mixin ApplyTheme($borderColor, $bgColor, $buttonColor) 
{ 
    .alert { 
        border: 2px solid $borderColor;

        padding: 20px; 
        h2 {

        button { 
            border:none; 
            padding: 5px; 
            width: 50px; 
            background-color: $borderColor; 
            color: $buttonColor; 
        } 
        a { 
            color:$borderColor; 
            margin-bottom: 20px 
        } 
    } 
} 
 
@if($themeName=="success") 
{ 
    @include ApplyTheme(green, rgb(207, 243, 207) , white); 
} 
@else if ($themeName=="danger") 
{ 
    @include ApplyTheme(rgb(198, 0, 0), rgb(244, 191, 191) , white ); 
} 
@else if($themeName=="warning") 
{ 
    @include ApplyTheme(rgb(186, 158, 0), rgb(251, 241, 184) , white ); 
} 
@else { 
    @include ApplyTheme(black, rgb(245, 240, 240) , white); 
} 
 
 
Iteration and Loops: - Sass uses @for as statement for creating loop or iterations. - A set of statements are executed repeatedly until the given condition is satisfied. - It uses a lower and upper bound value to initialize and end to loop. 
 
Syntax: 
    @for  $ref  from  initialValue   through   finalValue 
     { 
        // effects; 
     } 
 - Sass allows to bind a dynamic value with string by using the binding expression defined 
with "#{ }". 
 
Syntax: 
         .box-#{ $varName } 
          { 
 
          } 
 
Ex: 
index.scss 
 
 
div { 
    box-shadow: 4px 3px 2px black; 
    padding: 20px; 
    border:2px solid black; 
    width: 150px; 
    font-family: Arial; 
    font-size: 18px; 
} 
@for $i from 1 through 4 
{ 
    .box-#{$i} { 
        margin-left: $i * 150px; 
        margin-bottom: $i + 10px; 
        transform: skewX($i*5deg); 
    } 
}

6. Module System - Sass modules are "scss" files with "_" prefix. - You can define variables, functions, mixins and other styles in a module. - It allows to import and use only the required according to state and situation. - It enables 
    a) reusability 
    b) separation 
    c) modular approach - It makes styles light weight and faster in rendering. 
 
Note: The files that you configure as modules to import into another documents 
      will have "_" prefix. The main sass file should not container "_" prefix. 
 
Ex: 
_variables.scss 
 
$themeName : "success"; 
$space : 20px; 
 
_mixins.scss 
 
 
@mixin ApplyTheme($borderColor, $bgColor, $buttonColor) 
{ 
    .alert { 
        border: 2px solid $borderColor; 
        background-color: $bgColor; 
        padding: 20px; 
        h2 { 
            color: $borderColor; 
        } 
        p { 
            color:$borderColor; 
        } 
        button { 
            border:none; 
            padding: 5px; 
            width: 50px; 
            background-color: $borderColor; 
            color: $buttonColor; 
        } 
        a { 
            color:$borderColor; 
            margin-bottom: 20px 
        } 
    } 
}

Tailwind CSS 
 - It is a framework for CSS with pre-defined classes and components to build interactive 
and responsive UI rapidly. - It is compatible with all front end libraries and frameworks like angular, react, vue, etc. - You can implement in existing project or create a new application and setup tailwind as 
CSS framework. - To create a project and setup environment you need various bundling tools 
        a) webpack 
        b) vite 
        c) parcel 
 
Create a new project using Vite as bundler: 
 
1. Open any PC location in command project to create a project 
 
        D:\>npm  create   vite@latest 
 
        Project Name            :  vite-web-app 
 
        Select a framework        :   Others 
 
        Select variant            :   Extra Vite Starters 
 
        Select a template        :   Library 
 
        Select variant [library]    :   JavaScript 
 
2. After scaffolding the project change to project folder in command prompt 
 
        D:\> cd   vite-web-app 
 
        D:\vite-web-app> 
 
3. Run the command 
 
        > npm  install 
 
4. Open project folder in VS code  editor 
 
5.  Run project 
 
        > npm  run dev        [ development ] 
 
6.  Remove the HTML containers from  "index.html", keep body empty. 
 
7.  Remove all CSS code from  "styles.css"  and link to index.html 
 
    <head> 
    <link rel="stylesheet"  href="./styles.css"> 
    </head> 
 
8. Install Tailwind CSS for project created with Vite 
 
    >npm  install  tailwindcss    @tailwindcss/vite   
 
 
9. Go to "styles.css" 
 
    @import  "tailwindcss";        // it imports all tailwind classes 
 
10. Go to "vite.config.js" and add tailwind plugin for vite app. 
 
 
    import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'; 
 
    export default defineConfig({ 
       ....... 
       ......., 
       plugins : [ 
          tailwindcss() 
       ] 
        }) 
 
Ex: 
index.html 
 
<!doctype html> 
<html lang="en"> 
  <head> 
    <meta charset="UTF-8" /> 
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" /> 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> 
    <title>Vite App</title> 
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css"> 
  </head> 
  <body> 
     <h1 class="ms-4 border-4 border-green-600 border p-4 border-dotted text-3xl font-bold 
underline mt-4 font-family-Arial">Welcome to Tailwind CSS</h1> 
  </body> 
</html> 
 
Note: Tailwind provides pre-defined classes for various CSS attributes 
        a) Layout 
        b) Margin 
        c) Padding 
        d) Borders 
        e) Box Shadow 
        f) Typography  [font & text effects] etc. 
 
      <div  class="m-{ }  p-{ }  font-{ }>  </div> 
 
Build API & Database for To-Do Application 
1. Create a new database in MongoDB 
        
            todo 
 
2. Add collections 
 
    a) users 
        { 
            userid: string; 
            password: string; 
            email: string; 
        } 
 
    b) appointments 
        { 
          appointment_id: number; 
          title: string; 
          description: string; 
          date: date; 
          userid: string; 
        } 
 
3. Create API end points 
 
    GET        /users                        return all users 
    GET        /appointments                    return all appointments 
    GET        /appointments/1                returns specific appointment 
    
    POST    /register-user                    add new user into database 
    POST    /add-appointment                add new appointment 
    PUT        /edit-appointment/1            modify and update specific appointment 
    DELETE    /delete-appointment/1        remove specific appointment 
 
    > npm install  express  mongodb  cors --save 
 
4. Add a new folder "server" into jquery-to-do app 
 
5. Add a new file  "api.js" 
 
const mongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient; 
const cors = require("cors"); 
const express = require("express"); 
 
const conString = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"; 
 
const app = express(); 
app.use(cors()); 
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true})); 
app.use(express.json()); 
 
app.get('/users', (req, res)=>{ 
    mongoClient.connect(conString).then(clientObj=>{ 
         var database = clientObj.db("todo"); 
         database.collection('users').find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
              res.send(documents); 
              res.end(); 
         }); 
    }); 
}); 
 
app.get('/appointments', (req, res)=>{ 
    mongoClient.connect(conString).then(clientObj=>{ 
         var database = clientObj.db("todo"); 
         database.collection('appointments').find({}).toArray().then(documents=>{ 
              res.send(documents); 
              res.end(); 
         }); 
    }); 
}); 
 
app.get('/appointments/:id', (req, res)=>{ 
    mongoClient.connect(conString).then(clientObj=>{ 
         var database = clientObj.db("todo"); 
         database.collection('appointments').findOne({appointment_id:parseInt(req.params.i
d)}).then(document=>{ 
            res.send(document); 
            res.end(); 
         }); 
    }); 
}); 
 
app.post('/register-user', (req, res)=>{ 
 
    var user = { 
        userid: req.body.userid, 
        password: req.body.password, 
        email: req.body.email 
    } 
 
    mongoClient.connect(conString).then(clientObj=>{ 
        var database = clientObj.db("todo"); 
        database.collection('users').insertOne(user).then(()=>{ 
              console.log('User Registered'); 
              res.end(); 
        }); 
   }); 
}); 
 
app.post('/add-appointment', (req, res)=>{ 
 
    var appointment = { 
        appointment_id : parseInt(req.body.appointment_id), 
        title: req.body.title, 
        description: req.body.description, 
        date: new Date(req.body.date), 
        userid: req.body.userid 
    }; 
 
    mongoClient.connect(conString).then(clientObj=>{ 
        var database = clientObj.db("todo"); 
        database.collection('appointments').insertOne(appointment).then(()=>{ 
              console.log('Appointment Added'); 
              res.end(); 
        }); 
   }); 
}); 
 
app.put('/edit-appointment/:id', (req, res)=>{ 
 
    var id = parseInt(req.params.id); 
 
    var appointment = { 
        appointment_id : parseInt(req.body.appointment_id), 
        title: req.body.title, 
        description: req.body.description, 
        date: new Date(req.body.date), 
        userid: req.body.userid 
    }; 
 
    mongoClient.connect(conString).then(clientObj=>{ 
        var database = clientObj.db("todo"); 
        database.collection('appointments').updateOne({appointment_id:id},{$set:appointme
nt}) 
        .then(()=>{ 
            console.log('Appointment Updated'); 
            res.end(); 
        }); 
   }); 
}); 
 
app.delete('/delete-appointment/:id', (req, res)=>{ 
    var id = parseInt(req.params.id); 
 
    mongoClient.connect(conString).then(clientObj=>{ 
        var database = clientObj.db("todo"); 
        database.collection('appointments').deleteOne({appointment_id:id}) 
        .then(()=>{ 
            console.log('Appointment Deleted'); 
            res.end(); 
        }); 
   }); 
}); 
 
app.listen(4040); 
console.log(`Server Started http://127.0.0.1:4040`); 
 
6. Go to Index.js  and make changes in API requests and  appointment_id, userid 
 
                        index.js

Node MySQL Connection 
1. Install MySQL Drivers for your project 
 
    > npm install mysql --save 
 
2. Import MySQL module and create a new connection 
 
    const mysql  = require("mysql"); 
 
    var con = mysql.createConnection({ 
          host: "localhost", 
          user: "root", 
          password: "12345", 
          database: "shopping" 
    }); 
 
    con.connect(function(error){ 
         if(!error){ 
            console.log("connected.."); 
         } else { 
            console.log(error); 
         } 
    }) 
 
 
3. To Query on connected database you have to use "query()" method. 
 
    con.query("Your_SQL_Query", function(error, records, fields){ 
 
            if(!error) { 
                // actions... 
            } else { 
                   // report error; 
            } 
    }) 
 
Ex: 
demo.js 
 
var mysql = require("mysql"); 
 
var con = mysql.createConnection({ 
     host: 'localhost', 
     user: 'root', 
     password: '1234', 
     database: 'shopping' 
}); 
 
con.connect((err)=>{ 
    if(!err){ 
        console.log('Connected to MySql'); 
    } else { 
        console.log(err); 
    } 
}); 
con.query("Select * from tblproducts", function(error, records, fields){ 
     if(!error) { 
          console.log(records); 
     } else { 
         console.log(error); 
     } 
}) 
 
 
Ex: API & MySQL 
 
const express = require("express"); 
const mysql = require("mysql"); 
 
const con = mysql.createConnection({ 
     host: 'localhost', 
     user:'root', 
     password:'1234', 
     database: 'shopping' 
}); 
 
const app = express(); 
 
app.get("/products", (req, res)=>{ 
     con.connect(); 
     con.query('select * from tblproducts', (error, records, fields)=>{ 
          if(!error){ 
               res.send(records); 
               res.end(); 
          } else { 
             console.log(error); 
          } 
     }); 
}); 
 
app.post("/add-product", (req, res)=>{ 
    con.connect(); 
    con.query(`insert into tblproducts (Id, Name, Price) values (${req.body.Id}, 
${req.body.Name}, ${req.body.Price})`, (error)=>{ 
        if(!error){ 
            console.log('record inserted'); 
        } 
    }) 
}) 
 
app.listen(4030); 
console.log('Server Started');

Unit Testing 
FAQ: How we select a technology for project? 
Ans:  By verifying "AS-IS  & "TO-BE" with GAPS. 
 
     AS-IS            TO-BE            GAP 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
    what your         what client        Java 20% 
    technology        wants?            .NET 10% 
    is capable of?                        PHP 2% 
 
 
    AS-IS === TO-BE        => Test Pass 
    AS-IS !== TO-BE        => Test Fail 
 - JavaScript based technologies use various frameworks for testing, which includes 
 
        a) Jasmine - Karma 
        b) JEST 
 - JEST is a light weight testing framework for JavaScript based applications designed in 
Angular, React, Vue, Node etc. 
 
Setup Testing Framework for your project: 
 
1. Open your project terminal and install 
 
        >npm install  jest --save-dev 
 
        
2. Your application comprises of source code and test file 
 
          home.js        => contains your logic 
 
          home.test.js    => contains test functions 
          [home.spec.js] 
 
3. Add functions into source code. 
        home.js 
 
4. Import and link to HTML page. 
        
    <script type="module"> 
        import  { functions } from  "./home.js"; 
        .... 
    </script> 
 
5. Go to your test file  "home.test.js" 
    
    - Testing every function comprises of 3 phases 
        a) Arrange 
        b) Act 
        c) Assert 
    - Arrange imports required modules. 
    - Act defines the functionality to test. 
    - Asserts reports the test results. 
    - Every testing framework have a set of various functions for every phase. 
        
        test()        : It is used to arrange and configure your test 
        expect()        : It defines the act. 
        toBe...        : These are mock functions for verifying result [assert] 
 
Ex: 
1. Create a new project  "d:testing" 
 
2. Open Terminal 
 
        > npm init -y 
        > npm install  jest --save-dev 
 
3. Add files 
       home.js             
function Title(){ 
    return "Amazon"; 
} 
 
module.exports = Title; 
 
       total.js 
 
function Total(qty, price){ 
   return qty * price; 
} 
module.exports = Total; 
 
4. Add test files 
        home.test.js 
const Title = require("./home"); 
 
test("Title Test",()=>{ 
    expect(Title()).toBe("Amazon"); 
}); 
 
        total.test.js 
const Total = require("./total"); 
 
test("Total Test", ()=>{ 
    expect(Total(3,1000)).toBe(3000); 
}) 
 
5. Go to package JSON 
 
    { 
     scripts: { 
        "test"  : "jest" 
      } 
    } 
 
6. Run 
    > npm test
