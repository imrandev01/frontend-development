                            Minification
- It is a coding technique where the size of CSS file can be reduced by removing line breaks, optional code block, additional blank spaces, short references etc.
- Minified files are used for production and un-minified  files are used in development.

Ex:
1. Copy the actual CSS code
2. Visit the website

    https://www.toptal.com/developers/cssminifier

3. Paste the actual code
4. Click "Minify" button
5. Copy the minified code
6. Go to your project styles folder and add a new file
            ticket.min.css
7. Paste the minified code and link the minified file to page.

                             CDN
- It refers to Content Delivery Network.
- Projects maintain a repository server [sandbox] where the css files are kept and access directly from server.
- You can use the styles across projects.

Ex:
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.3/font/bootstrap-icons.min.css"&gt;
</head>

                          Selectors in Style Object
- Object is a key and value collection.
- It keeps all related data and logic together.
- Style object is applied to HTML element using selectors.

Syntax:
        selector
        {
          color:red;
          text-align:center;
        }

- CSS provides various types of selectors to select HTML elements.
- We can categorize them into following groups

            1. Primary Selectors
            2. Rational Selectors
            3. Attribute Selectors
            4. Dynamic Pseudo classes
            5. Structural Pseudo classes
            6. Element state pseudo classes
            7. Validation state pseudo classes
            8. Universal selector
            9. Language selector
            10. Root selector etc...

Primary Selectors
1. Type Selector
2. Id Selector
3. Class Selector

Type Selector:
- It refers to element token name.
    h1, p, div, span, table, td, dt, etc..
- Type selector are good to apply at every occurrence of element in page.
- You can't skip at any specific occurrence.

Syntax:
    h1 {
      color:red;
    }

ID Selector:
- Every element can have a reference "Id" [Identification]
- CSS can access the ID using "#" reference and can define effects.
- You can apply style to specific element.
- HTML element can't have multiple "Id" references.
- Hence you can't apply multiple categories of styles to one element using ID selectors.

Syntax:
    #text-style
    {
      color:red;
    }

    <div id="text-style">
    <h1 id="text-style">

Class Selector:
- It is defined by using "." and reference name.
- It is accessed and applied to element using "class" attribute.
- You can apply multiple classes to one element.

Syntax:
    .text-style {  }
    .bg-style { }

    <div  class="text-style bg-style">

Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        .text-style {
           color:red;
           text-align: center;
        }
        .border-style {
           border: 2px solid red;
        }
        .bg-style {
          background-color: yellow;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 class="text-style border-style bg-style">Web Technologies</h1>
</body>
</html>

FAQ: If styles are applied to element using id, type & class then which set will apply?
Ans:  According to priority if same attributes are used.
        1st         Id
        2nd        Class
        3rd         Type
      It can apply all if different attributes are used.

Ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        h1 {
          color:red;
          border:1px solid red;
        }
        #text-style {
          color:green;
        }
        .effect {
           color:blue;
           padding: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1  class="effect" id="text-style">Web Technologies</h1>
</body>
</html>
