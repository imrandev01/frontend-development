sack to tat)

1. Ternary Operator ?:
2. new operator             : Dynamic memory allocation operator.
3. typeof                   : It returns the data type of value stored in a reference.
4. in operator              : It can search for a key in object and return Boolean true/false.
                                
                                "Price" in product; // true - false

5- delete                   : It can remove a key from object-
                                delete product.Price;
6. of operator              : It can read value of a property in an iterator.
                                for(var item of collection)
                                {

                                }
7. instanceof               : It returns true if object is instance of specified class.

8. void                     : It discards the return of a function.
                            <a href="javascript:void()"> Text </a> 

7. yield                    : It yields the result of an iterator. 

                                JavaScript Statements
-A statement is used to control the execution flow in a program.
-JavaScript statements are classified into
                1. Selection Statements
                    if, else, switch, case, default
                2. Looping Statements
                    for, while, do while
                3. Iteration Statements
                    for..in, for..
                4. jump Statements
                    break, continue, return
                5.Exception Handling Statements
                    try, catch, throw, finally

Looping Control Statements:
-Looping is the process of executing a set of statements repeatedly until the given condition is satisfied.

- You can create loops with
        a) for 
        b) while
        c) do while

The "for" loop:
- It is a looping control statement used by developer when it is sure about number of iterations and iteration counter will not change dynamically.

- It requires an initialization, condition and counter.

Syntax:

    for(initialization; condition; counter)
    {

    }

    initialization          : It specifies the starting point
    condition               : It decides the ending
    counter                 : It defines how to proceed. [increment, decrement or step]

Ex- 
    for(var i=1)




Tasks:-
1.  Write a program to count the occurrence of a string in message 
2.  Write a program to find the word is palindrome or not.
3.  Write a program to print all values greater then 4000 from an array of numbers.

                        [2000, 57000, 53100, 43000]
4.  Write a program to print array element in ordered list 

                        ["All", "Electronic", "Fashion"]

                        1. All
                        2. Electronic
                        3. Fashion
