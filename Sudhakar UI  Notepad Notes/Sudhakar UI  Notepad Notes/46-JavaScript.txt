- Light weight allows to run on device or in environment with less memory.
- Interpreted allows line by line translation.
- Compiled allows translation of all lines simultaneously at the same time.
- There are 2 types of compiling techniques
    a) JIT
    b) AOT
- JIT is "Just-in-Time", which compiles the code only when it is requested.
- AOT is "Ahead-of-Time", which compiles the code at application level before it is requested.
- JavaScript is a language that supports various programming techniques and approaches like
    a) Structural Programming
    b) Imperative Programming

Evolution of JavaScript:
- CERN labs introduced ECMA Script, which is known as the base for all scripts in the world.
- Internet started with a browser called Mosaic, which uses ECMA script & HTML.
- Netscape communications started a browser called Netscape Communicator in 1995.
- Netscape appointed "Brendan Eich" to develop a script for their browser.
- He designed a script by name "Moca", later renamed as "Live Script".
- Netscape given the responsibility of Live Script to Sun Micro Systems. [Java]
- Sun Micro Systems and Netscape together name the script as "JavaScript".
- In 2000 Netscape stopped its services and given the responsibility of JavaScript to ECMA.
- Latest version of JavaScript is ESNext [Alpha], the stable and standard versions used in companies
        ECMA 2015        ES5
        ECMA 2016        ES6
        …
        ECMA 2022
